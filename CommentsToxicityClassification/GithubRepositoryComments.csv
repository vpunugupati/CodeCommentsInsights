655030369,2220,Issue,release_notes: Updated documentation to refer to `main` branch,,,,,,
645328258,2214,Issue,"This needs to exist in the GitHub API to be supported in Octokit, but I don't see it documented here: please bump this issue when you see the API is available",,,,,,
643395373,2212,Issue,closed here as i need for rest apis,,,,,,
643235967,2211,Issue,You need to specify a User-Agent header to interact with the GitHub API:,,,,,,
644067151,2211,Issue,"Hi It is Working with adding User-Agent.client.Headers.Add(""User-Agent"", ""Awesome-Octocat-App"");Thank you very much.",,,,,,
642926604,2208,Issue,"is there a public repository you can share that illustrates the problem? (or was showing the issue?)The first thing that comes to mind here is caching, with three potential ways to get this number: - `watchers_count` on the repository returned via the API could be cached for a period of time because of all the different places in the GitHub API where `repository` is used - enumerating the [List Watchers] API would require getting the latest details about each watcher, and thus is more likely to be correct (but slower) - but if the website is showing a different watchers count it could be computing this in a different way to the API",,,,,,
642930612,2208,Issue,"would work (if you provide a key/orgName in settings, and disable the auth). I'll try to get a simpler repro. The current state of that PR has both data points showing side by side in the details page for a given repository. I'll try to do a PR off of my PR so that you can just provide a key & orgName and not muck around with other stuff.I think I've ruled out caching as a consideration on my end because this is happening on startup of the app on first view (we retrieve the list of repositories and there's another ""detail"" page where I provide the results of getting watchers via the activity API). The summary page is returning Watcher.I'd expect GitHub caching wouldn't be relevant here. This is a tool to archive old repos, and some of these watchers haven't changed for years so I imagine would be showing up.Although...maybe it's *because* the repos in question are old that the WatcherCount property is smaller than I'd expect?",,,,,,
642932664,2208,Issue,"repro branch here: Requires you to input AccessToken and OrganizationName in appSettings or user secrets.In my case, the steps are:* Click  ""Sunsetting"" in the menu* A list of repos will load* Choose a repository to go to its details page* Note the item under the eye icon (from the Repository object) and the Watchers (from the activity API) are different. ![image]I can't understand if there's anything in particular about a given repo that causes this to be the returned number.One thought -- is there a difference between people who are subscribed vs auto-subscribed because they watch repositories by default in an org? If the default folks wouldn't count toward WatcherCount, we may be on to something.",,,,,,
642934512,2208,Issue,"What's wild about your repo is that the field we're supposed to be deprecating is correct when looking at it directly from the API ``:I was under the impression that we were standardizing on one value here, but the [example repo] in our docs makes me wonder if they're actually different underneath, and this is just some confusion between the API and the website itself.Also, the [List Watchers API] is actually described as `GET /repos/:owner/:repo/subscribers` and in your situation `` returns the 3 entities. So maybe `watchers_count` is actually the value that we're supposed to obsolete? I need to investigate some more because it's all rather fuzzy right now...",,,,,,
642935391,2208,Issue,So maybe watchers_count is actually the value that we're supposed to obsolete?I think you're on to something there. Mostly I'm relieved that it's at least stumped you temporarily too. 😆,,,,,,
642936063,2208,Issue,"What's wild about your repo is that the field we're supposed to be deprecating is correct when looking at it directly from the API Ah, to be clear, this repo isn't the one with the incorrect count. It's the one with the project that is utilizing Octokit. May be worth confirming [the repro steps against the branch I linked earlier]. (This is not urgent by the way. I appreciate you jumping on it so quickly but if you need to return to it later I understand.)",,,,,,
643010764,2208,Issue,"One other theory I'm going to follow up on but dropping here:This org is a private org and some people have since moved on. I wonder if it's possible that the watchers list contains people who no longer have access, and so the effective Watcher count is therefore smaller.",,,,,,
642600364,2207,Issue,"that stack trace doesn't seem to mention Octokit, and it looks like it's related to NLog trying to format a GUID found in some payload. We don't use NLog inside Octokit, so I'm not sure how to reproduce this or what the root cause is.",,,,,,
642609218,2207,Issue,"Yeah it was due to our logger which hides real exception.  The exception was actually not found. Does release api need to pass credentials?Octokit.NotFoundException: Not Found   at Octokit.Connection.HandleErrors(IResponse response) in /Users/shiftkey/src/octokit.net/Octokit/Http/Connection.cs:line 663   at Octokit.Connection.RunRequest(IRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) in /Users/shiftkey/src/octokit.net/Octokit/Http/Connection.cs:line 642   at Octokit.Connection.Run[T](IRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) in /Users/shiftkey/src/octokit.net/Octokit/Http/Connection.cs:line 626   at Octokit.ApiConnection.Post[T](Uri uri, Object data, String accepts, String contentType) in /Users/shiftkey/src/octokit.net/Octokit/Http/ApiConnection.cs:line 273",,,,,,
642611291,2207,Issue,"yes, releases need the `client.Credentials` to be set as [the documentation] indicates: Users with push access to the repository can create a release.",,,,,,
642612700,2207,Issue,Yeah it is working now. Thx a lot for helping me!,,,,,,
642292186,2205,Issue,"I don't see it listed on the [Issues API page], or as a [Preview API], so I think we're stuck for the moment.",,,,,,

642923797,2205,Issue,"For the moment I'm going to close this out, but if this does appear as a preview API we can reopen it.",,,,,,

639761082,2199,Issue,"This is not supported via the GitHub API, likely due to the potential for abuse.",,,,,,
640283449,2198,Issue,release_notes: Updated `xunit.runner.visualstudio` to latest version,,,,,,
639230264,2197,Issue,what is the process to get this reviewed?,,,,,,
639455442,2197,Issue,a bit of patience - aiming to throw some spare time on the weekend towards these side projects as Life™ and Work™ have been hectic this past week.,,,,,,

640283702,2196,Issue,release_notes: Add server time difference to `ApiInfo` API,,,,,,
636869502,2195,Issue,Is this just a missing feature (PR accepted?) or is it not there for a reason?Likely an oversight. I can't think of a reason for excluding it.,,,,,,
637448434,2195,Issue,No worries. Submitted a PR to add it in!,,,,,,
636482576,2194,Issue,this is a great spot - thanks for adding in that convention test. Gonna have a read over the changes and see if I have any suggestions to improve it.,,,,,,
640283623,2194,Issue,release_notes: `ChecksClient` constructor should take interface arguments,,,,,,
631539914,2190,Issue,does the API work as expected if you pass the owner and name for the private repository?,,,,,,
631540518,2190,Issue,"Unfortunately not, I have to say that the owner is an organization, don't know if it makes any difference",,,,,,
631541907,2190,Issue,There's this caveat about [this API] documented on GitHub: Information about published releases are available to everyone. Only users with push access will receive listings for draft releases.Could that be relevant to what you're seeing?,,,,,,
631542544,2190,Issue,"Also note that tags may be listed in the Releases page for the repository, but they are not considered a release (and would be returned from the Releases API).",,,,,,
631544235,2190,Issue,"Well I can see that I have releases in the github page by using the same user, I will try with the tags api instead...",,,,,,
631545716,2190,Issue,"OPs, a separate tags api apparently does not exist in octokit, am I wrong?",,,,,,
631546154,2190,Issue,yes I'm wrong :),,,,,,
631547870,2190,Issue,"I can confirm, Tags works, ( and it is a good workaround for me ) for releases, I dont't really know if the problem is the caveat, should not because I can see on the page the releases, but I don't understand really.",,,,,,
631550837,2190,Issue,"For reference: I dont't really know if the problem is the caveat, should not because I can see on the page the releases, but I don't understand really.I believe this is a historical thing on the website because of this workflow: - someone pushes a tag to the repository, and now wants to create the corresponding release - they go to the releases tab, and see the new tag alongside the current release - they click the tag, fill in the additional details for the release, and publish  - the new release is now listed on the releases page, which links to the tag chosen by the userIt saved having to go somewhere else to do this, but does introduce the ""is a tag a release?"" source of confusion in the UI.Anyway, closing this out as resolved.",,,,,,

640298335,2189,Issue,Yessss,,,,,,
632924713,2188,Issue,"Or if we should open an issue in the dotnet project (I really don't know why AllowRedirect is not supported by Blazor wasm) let's start from there, as I don't have much control over `HttpClientHandler` and how it can be used from Blazor.The relevant code is here:",,,,,,
639726077,2188,Issue,Exactly same bug here :-(,,,,,,
639736848,2188,Issue,It works on .net coreBut .net standard doesn't have SslProtocolsPlease help!,,,,,,
639752586,2188,Issue,I need more information to understand the problem you're seeing,,,,,,
639756536,2188,Issue,"When you try to authenticate Octokit in blazor, which runs on .net standard framework, you get the above error This page gives an answer It seems aws are also getting the same problem",,,,,,
639795225,2188,Issue,the only area I'm aware of where we enable these in the library is here:This is only enabled for `net46`:This shouldn't be enabled for .NET Standard as we don't include that `ifdef`.,,,,,,
640013074,2188,Issue,"I was playing with this error for few hours.Things I saw,- Create .net standard 2.0 project, refer octokit.net nuget and consume it -> WORKS  - Create .net standard 2.1 project (like Blazor wasm), refer octokit.net nuget, consume it with a .net core 3.1 app -> WORKS  - Create .net standard 2.1 project (like Blazor wasm), refer octokit.net nuget, consume it -> ERROR  - Clone this repo, Remove `AllowAutoRedirect = false` from HttpMessageHandlerFactory.cs, Consume it with a .net standard 2.1 project (like Blazor wasm)  -> Above error is gone, But It does not really Authenticate GitHubClient on             `Client = new GitHubClient(new ProductHeaderValue(""Product Name""))            {                Credentials = new Credentials(username, password)            };`So I get It's framework issues, I'm very thankful for helping us on these :-)",,,,,,
640019490,2188,Issue,It looks like Blazor Web Assembly doesn't have AllowAutoRedirect property because HttpClientHandler is implemented via JavaScript APIs. There is an issue with `SecurityProtocolType.Tls12`This guy has [Modified octokit.net to use with blazor]He changed `_http = new HttpClient(new RedirectHandler { InnerHandler = getHandler() });`toof `Http/HttpClientAdapter.cs`When I do that it still says `Octokit.AuthorizationException: Bad Credentials at Octokit.Connection.HandleErrors`Exactly same code runs well on .net core,,,,,,
640057674,2188,Issue,", I agree with your observation on why `AutoRedirect` does not work in Blazor. Also see [#16955]. Though this is marked as closed, you can see that there are still open comments about it. To workaround this, the best way is to remove the `AutoRedirect` property in the `HttpMessageHandlerFactory.cs` file and not setting it to True. For whatever reason, Blazor does not like we setting the value (even if it is the default value) to this property. Also, you can remove the default handler completely when creating HttpClient instance but this prevents additional code in the default handler which might work. I assume there must be a reason why Octokit prevents `AutoRedirect` in the implementation. It is better if someone can explain that so that you are not creating any other issue down the line by enabling it.As with the auth issue, I suppose it is because [Basic Auth is deprecated]. I have tried with my Personal Access Token and it is working for me. I used below syntax It might be worth retrying with a PAT after 2FA is enabled just to see if it is an issue with Basic Auth.",,,,,,
640059171,2188,Issue,"I assume there must be a reason why Octokit prevents `AutoRedirect` in the implementation. It is better if someone can explain that so that you are not creating any other issue down the line by enabling it. from memory this is still kept around due to behaviour around edge cases that have built up over the years:The [blame for this file] has more context and links to the relevant commits, and I think there were cases around us having to explicitly handle things better than the defaults on Windows (where this library originated) that may no longer be necessary.",,,,,,
640094036,2188,Issue,"### Everyone, thank you very much - Issue is fixed!Just like  said **I removed the line ` AllowAutoRedirect = false `** from HttpMessageHandlerFactory.cs  Then octokit didn't authenticated because, HTTPClient get redirected and doesn't return the correct result back when using **password** authentication.  But just like  said, **this doesn't occur in Personal Token Based Auth**. So using token instead of password allowed me to Authenticate without any error.   _p.s. I'll make this repo public as soon as our 'Account servers' are ready. So anyone could cope with this_  Again thanks for quick help!",,,,,,
621528814,2185,Issue,"When the new integration test is run locally it fails on this line when attempting to retrieve the master branch from the newly created repository:The error is: Octokit.ApiException : Git Repository is empty.In debugging I confirmed the repository is created. When I run `PullRequestsClientTests.CanCreate` it passes, so I am convinced I have done something wrong writing this new test. Any ideas?",,,,,,
627611683,2185,Issue,"I figured out what I was doing wrong.The tests for cards did not require auto-init, now they do.I also had to update the `NewProjectCard` object to use a `long` instead of `int` for the `ContentId` property, since PullRequest Id's are a `long` and not an `int` like Issues.Additionally, the helper method I was using was incorrect, since it only supported creating Issue cards, so another helper was introduced to keep the test styles consistent with the other tests.I have squashed my commits and pushed.",,,,,,

619580834,2181,Issue,can you provide more information: - which repository are you testing? - what value did you expect to get?,,,,,,
619583668,2181,Issue,"I've used RepositoryClient from GitHubClient to get all repositories of a provided user (tested with ""unclebob"") and every result had subscribers count = 0. And if I'm not mistaken, subscribers count is basically a watchers count? If not, is it possible to get watchers count in Repository object? What I'm trying to accomplish is to get all the data about user repositories within one request and everything is there, except watchers count.",,,,,,
619591193,2181,Issue,"looking at an example from that user I no longer see `subscribers_count` in the underlying JSON:There was some API churn ages ago which lead to this duplication between ""subscribers"" (which we didn't have an equivalent in the UI) and ""watchers"" (which was there in the UI), but I suspect it's been cleaned up recently. I think you want `WatchersCount` in C# but I'll leave this open to verify and properly deprecate the fields if they're no longer sent by GitHub.",,,,,,
619591727,2181,Issue,"Yeah, exactly. But apart from marking SubscribersCount as deprecated, is there a chance to get WatchersCount property in the near future?",,,,,,
619622073,2181,Issue,I'd take a PR to add the property to [`Octokit/Models/Response/Repository.cs`] in the meantime.,,,,,,

618396649,2179,Issue,"I don't believe this is currently available through the GitHub API.Generally these sorts of features are exposed as a [preview API] first, so until that is available there's not much we can do from the Octokit side.",,,,,,
613578856,2176,Issue,"Thanks for the feedback! I've adjusted accordingly. I also named it `CodesOfConductClient` instead of `CodeOfConductClient` (Code is singular instead of plural), since that's how GitHub officially refers it to:",,,,,,

605505629,2161,Issue,"thanks for the report. I've isolated this to how headers are returned when an unauthenticated request is made.This tests shows how the headers for rate-limiting information differ:Note the `Ratelimit` returned from the first command - the lower-case `l` here is why we are unable to parse the numbers from the header.As a workaround, I recommend setting the `Credentials` property on your `GitHubClient` to perform an authenticated request. This will also give you a larger number of API calls to work with - unauthenticated requests are limited to 60 requests per hour.I need to investigate the root cause of this on our end, and will close this out when it's been resolved.",,,,,,
605508673,2161,Issue,Ok. This seems like a bug in the API from GitHub...I currently use octokit library in This is currently just using the free unauthenticated API.Is it a good idea to include an authenticated call in an public application which is used by multiple people at the same time?How is the rate limit calculated? Is this 5000 per system/user or 5000 in total?An another request: if possible retarget .net framework 4.5.2 in octokit because this is missing from the latest?,,,,,,
605515188,2161,Issue,"How is the rate limit calculated? Is this 5000 per system/user or 5000 in total?Essentially 5000 per user, but [the documentation has more information about the specifics]. Is it a good idea to include an authenticated call in an public application which is used by multiple people at the same time?Yes. 60 requests/hour may not allow much usage before rate-limiting is enforced.I see you have a documented `--token` parameter for private repositories - if users are seeing themselves get rate-limited then they can add this to get the increased API request count (for public or private repositories). An another request: if possible retarget .net framework 4.5.2 in octokit because this is missing from the latest?This deprecation was flagged back in [`0.35`] in October last year because upstream dependencies had dropped these versions: As part of keeping up with current target frameworks in .NET, we will be deprecating `net45` and `netstandard1.1` targets in a future release. This update adds `net46` and `netstandard2.0` outputs which will become the new baseline, so please test them out in your projects and report any issues you encounter.In February (so 5ish months later) [`v0.41`] dropped the older versions: Octokit and Octokit.Reactive now have a minimum target of `net46` and `netstandard2.0` to keep up with the minimum supported versions of Reactive Extensions for .NET. `v0.40.0` is the last version that targets `net45` or `netstandard1.0`, but you will need to upgrade your projects to continue to get further updates and fixes.To continue to receive updates you will need to retarget `net46`. I'm not sure if there's a specific dependency that is blocking you from doing this upgrade, but I'd been falling behind keeping up with `System.Reactive` which forced me to plan for this deprecation.",,,,,,
601797802,2159,Issue,are you referring to [this announced feature]?Unless there is a [documented API] or a [preview API] underway then we are unable to supported it in the client API.,,,,,,

So if we try to get value from `StringEnum.Value` and `StringEnum` contains unknown value, exception will be raised.Ideally, we should keep `EventInfoState` enum up-to-date with all new values but, actually, GitHub API docs are very outdated and it doesn't contain description of those fields that I have added in this PR.

591504960,2101,Issue,"I know the properties, [I designed the type] 😉  I believe that TryParse is not needed here.You basically have three options for consuming a `StringEnum`:1. Use `StringValue` which is always safe, but as you noted, it's inconvenient.1. Use `Value` which is unsafe (throws) for unknown values.1. Use `TryParse(out EventInfoState state)`, which gives you back an enum value for known values, but still allows you to handle unknown values gracefully.Personally, and especially for `EventInfoState`, I would always use `TryParse` to make sure my code doesn't start blowing up just because GitHub added a new event type 😄  GitHub API docs are very outdated and it doesn't contain description of those fields that I have added in this PR. I have found these values by practice way - just run parsing events for all issues in my repo but, of course, it could be not full list.Exactly, that's why `StringEnum.TryParse` exist in the first place. From [the docs]: Since new functionality introduced on GitHub.com frequently leads to additional event types being received, Octokit was constantly playing catchup with these Enum values.

Through much experimentation we have found that uninstalling the GitHub App and reinstalling it does temporarily make the private repos visible; but again, only temporarily.This makes me wonder if there's a bug in GHES about GitHub Apps and repository visibility, but the fact that it works initially and then stops working is fascinating. Your version `2.19.6` is only from last month, so I don't think an upgrade here will fix it. I checked the release notes for [`2.19.7`] and [`2.20.0`] and couldn't see anything obvious to indicate that this has been resolved. This might require your administrators who manage the GHES installation to contact [GitHub Enterprise Support] and work with them to properly investigate the problem.What happens if you use a personal access token instead - does that work as expected?",,,,,,

I see that there are integration tests, but I'm not sure how you'd suggest we approach those.I think initially focusing on tests against the read API (so we're not creating things and potentially triggering abuse mechanisms) would be a good start - this will help confirm we're getting information from the API and it's being deserialized correctly. Then we can expand things.    There are now 3 different types of Token (AccessToken, RunnerRegistrationToken, and RunnerRemoveToken). This doesn't seem great, since they're all the same. I would have created a generic Token class, but I wasn't sure how the project handles changes to existing APIs (AccessToken already existed). Thoughts?I'd be hesitant to merge these unless we're very confident they'll stay the same. Looking at `AccessToken` for example, it's actually much more than just those two values which aren't deserialized from the API:I'd prefer to enhance that with the additional fields in a follow-up PR. With these new `RunnerRegistrationToken` and `RunnerRemoveToken` types, I think it's fine to leave them as-is - who knows how the API might evolve?

The only supported methods are Basic Authentication (discouraged for security reasons, and some APIs will reject basic authentication), and Tokens (either Personal Access Token or OAuth apps).If you're wanting to make API calls on behalf of a user, I'd recommend creating an OAuth app for your organization as it avoids the need for the user to create a PAT, defers authenticating the user to GitHub, and users can see and revoke the permission in the future.But it sounds like you want this to work on the user's local machine, which is a different workflow that doesn't work best with OAuth.",,,,,,

590383565,2054,Issue,"I can't take this PR in in it's current form because it's not clear to me what we're trying to achieve here.  * The request timeout is hard-coded inside Request class constructor (TimeSpan.FromSeconds(100))This was chosen as it matches the default value for [`HttpClient.Timeout`]. * GitHubClient.SetRequestTimeout() method does not change the request timeout as expected: hard-coded Request.Timeout is applied instead.This is the bit I'd like to understand more about. Inside Octokit we use the request timeout to create a cancellation token (or combine it with an existing cancellation token):This is the recommended approach to differentiate between global and per-request timeouts mentioned in the documentation link above: You may also set different timeouts for individual requests using a `CancellationTokenSource` on a task. **Note that only the shorter of the two timeouts will apply**.What are we trying to do here? I don't believe plumbing a new property all the way through the internals is the best approach here, and will potentially confuse callers. * GitHubClient does not provide an ability to get/read an effective request timeoutIt's not clear to me the value of this, and as mentioned in the previous point ""effective"" here requires a better understanding about what the goals or issues are.",,,,,,

In the sample below the shorter is hardcoded in the Request class constructor.The code looks like the timeout is 3 minutes. But the timeout is 100 seconds instead. It is a bug.Plus, if the library provides ""SetRequestTimeout"" method, I would expect it to provide ""GetRequestTimeout"" as well. Currently there is no API to get an effective timeout, even if you want to get it it for diagnostic purposes.Eliminating hardcoded timeout - is a bug-fix actually.New property - is a feature request to make an API clean.

It did have some interest in submitting a contribution but that seemed to have trailed off. Maybe it's worth checking in with that discussion to see if it can be moved along?

In this scenario (when a user is likely using an internal email address, and used it by mistake when contributing to an open source project), we have had to handle the fact that Author can be null, and instead, revert to using the raw `Name` attribute of the commit, rather than the GitHub user.It would be nice in this scenario if there were a property which said `VerifiedUser` or similar.Could be that this is a similar problem to what you are seeing.",,,,,,

By default `GetAll` will follow pagination if there is more data to get, so this is a way to ignore data you don't need and save on network requests and downloads.It won't change the API result (still an array of commits), but it becomes a bit easier to understand what data you are looking for:",,,,,,

477569361,1955,Issue,Do the examples here help anything?It does not really explain why the first call hangs though,,,,,,
477835133,1955,Issue,"Hi -Zuber I had read through that doco but I don't understand why _call 1_ hangs.Also, the doco isn't overly clear how PageCount is handled. The return value for GetAllForRepository is List of Labels but it's not paged. So does octokit retrieve x number of pages (where x =  PageCount ) via the GitHub API and then merge these pages into a single list of Labels which is returned?In most APIs PageCount refers to the number of pages that is returned. Usually there is a page object which contains a number of values (in this case it would be Labels).",,,,,,
477867990,1955,Issue,"yeah, the way Octokit works is that the actually returned result is concatenated into a single list of results. I do not see anything in the git history that discuss why though.I started writing a test for this case, but the second call hangs for me as well. Is the repository open source?",,,,,,
478182734,1955,Issue,"The GitHub API itself only supports `start_page` and `page_size` settings for pagination, but the way we implemented pagination support in Octokit.net is that we also have a `PageCount` property where the library will fetch that many pages for you, and yes the results are always concatenated into a single list.  Also note if you provide no `ApiOptions` then the library will fetch ALL pages for you.  The reason for the results being a list and not actually exposing pagination in the responses is due to a combination of factors such as ""history"", trying to remain backwards compatible (pagination was implemented after the library was well established) and trying to be idiomatic to typical usage/expectations of .NET/c# which was (at the time) deemed to be returning `List` types and having consumers use `Linq` to manipulate the lists.  Eg if you wanted the first 100 then use `.Take(100)` rather than exposing ""pages"" to the consumer.Personally Im pretty happy about not having to deal with ""pages"" of results if you dont want to - if you do want to then you can use `PageCount=1` and loop through results... but if you don't want to you can do say `PageSize=100`, `PageCount=5` and know you will get up to 500 results without any mucking around with loops etc.That said, hindsight is wonderful and I do think our implementation could have been better if it was some sort of wrapped response class as that would have allowed us to expose things that are in response headers, such as the first and last page numbers... eg something like `OctokitResponse`But in terms of the actual problem raised in this issue, it totally SHOULD work in that case, so we need to look at how/why that call is hanging!",,,,,,
480264543,1955,Issue,"I put together this test to see the behaviour for myself:I also put Fiddler in the middle to see for myself what was happening, and this looks like why it is deadlocking - it continually re-requests the same URL:; rel=""last""`But the client doesn't seem to use this updated `repositories/179678946/labels?per_page=11&page=2` - that's the part I'm still trying to investigate here.",,,,,,
486164781,1955,Issue,"I spent some time debugging this and what is happening is inside the pagination loop. we are taking the ""next"" Url from the link header `` and passing it into our extension method `Uri.ApplyParameters(nextUrl, parameters)` to ""re-apply"" any relevant parameters from the original request, to our subsequent page request (not sure if this is even necessary as wouldnt the link header from the upstream API echo back any required query parameters in the link header???).  So what we end up with is `nextUri` contains `per_page=11&page=2` and  the original `parameters` we are re-applying has `per_page=11&page=1` and the result of the `ApplyParameters` is our desired `page=2` gets trumped by the original `page=1`.It seems most likely to have been introduced as a side effect by another pagination fix in #1649 (yes, almost 2 years ago!)This is a bit of a brain twister 🤔 but I think we haven't run into this in all this time is that I believe this will only happen if you specified a `StartPage` value.  If you don't specify `StartPage` then the original Uri has no `page=x` parameter that will then clobber the desired page number for subsequent calls.  I can only conclude that most people retrieving multiple pages are probably not specifying a start page as they are happy with the default (being page 1) but arent explicitly setting it?",,,,,,
486924301,1955,Issue,Good find . It looks like that is the case. I was also just using the default until recently. Will be nice getting a fix for this one.,,,,,,
519119775,1955,Issue,"I am trying to retrieve all Issue events for a repository.  I worked around another bug with Int32 MaxValues, but I get back 40000 results now.

459293871,1935,Issue,"Hi -Tas   enabling the user to login through his/her GitHub credentials (email and password), improving the experience.Im not sure if this is an improved experience, considering that with a token the user has at least some ability to limit your application to certain scopes/functionality, whereas by providing you with their username and password they are open to your application being able to do ANYTHING they can do themselves!With that comment aside though, what you are running into is perhaps a case of unfortunately named parameters.  A GitHub user has a login (their handle - in my case `ryangribble`) and an email address.  You can log in to GitHub with either of those (try it on the login screen yourself!).Meanwhile the GitHub API requires the actual `login` field (not the email address) as that is directly used in the URI's to API routes that are called.Not to worry though, you can get information about the ""current"" user (ie the one you are authenticating as) using:You can then use the `user.Login` parameter in the other API calls you need to make.Hope that helps!",,,,,,

The name of the fully qualified reference (ie: refs/heads/master). If it doesn't start with 'refs' and have at least two slashes, it will be rejected.Nevertheless I think this change makes things less surprising and better for users so I'm cool with it... I would ask 2 things though:- if we no longer require the ref to be formatted in a particular way, could we remove that XmlComment in the code, that tells users not to pass in `refs/` ?- Since the Update (patch) endpoint has the same behaviour, can we ensure this is also updated/tested in octokit with similar changes?

I'm not sure if this is because the time support was added to GitHub after octokit had implemented request or whether it was just an oversight.What we could do in order to not affect existing behaviour is keep the existing `ctor`s that accept `DateTime` and mark them `[Obsolete]`, having them continue to only format the query string as YYYYMMDD, then add new `ctor`s that take `DateTimeOffset` types (giving us timezone info as well) and being formatted out to the full ISO8601 timestamp format including time zone info.

However I don't think you'd need to sort them yourself as the API should already return them in reverse chronological order. Furthermore if you use the `ApiOptions` overload you can request only 1 page of results and that will keep things to an efficient single call (our default behaviour is to loop through and call all pages, so you should use the override to control this)See raw API response showing a single page of reverse chronological ordered results:",,,,,,

If you do have an issue related to this library (octokit.net) can you please clarify a bit more? Thanks",,,,,,
426929939,1883,Issue,In the docs OAUTH flow example you save the accessToken in a session and then access it in different actions.This works fine for when I am do this on my own localhost but when I try to do this through my Google Extension for GitHub the cookies are never persisted and so the session is always empty.Is their any other way than using Session to get the credentials for each action?,,,,,,
426943837,1883,Issue,Ah sorry I thought you were referring to a personal access token So it sounds like the fact there's a chrome extension involved is a complicating factor?  I'm still not quite putting everything together here though sorry - are you developing a chrome extension yourself and trying to have it perform the oauth flow (I can't see how that works since you need github to hit a url to perform some of the flow) or are you saying you have a chrome extension installed that is somehow affecting what you're trying to do with an asp.net website that is trying to do oauth flow with github?,,,,,,
426950932,1883,Issue,"Yeah, thanks for the help.Here's the full flow:I am creating a chrome extension for GitHub, similar to ZenHub extension.

426867149,1882,Issue,"Hey ,Nested Teams support in github means that this is expected behaviour. If a team has a parent team then that child team does ""own"" all the repos they inherit from the parent. The reason your test curl API call doesn't show this, is that nested teams is still in preview mode and requires a custom header to be passed to enable the preview feature. But once the preview is over, the default API behaviour will change to this anyway so there isn't much to be gained in holding onto the old behaviour. In octokit.net we typically implement the preview features because our users generally want the latest and greatest, and unfortunately it's not possible to opt out (except by using a previous version before we implemented the bested teams stuff). As mentioned, it's a dead end to keep relying on the old behaviour anyway so you'll have to adapt at some point 😁Https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/#check-if-a-team-manages-a-repository",,,,,,
426912489,1882,Issue,"Thanks for such a detailed answer!Personally, I'm disappointed, because the new behavior feels counter-intuitive.However, it's not related to Octokit.NET itself, so I'm closing this issue.",,,,,,
426938997,1882,Issue,No worries! I don't personally think it's counter intuitive since it's just an inheritance mechanism - so a child team should have all the permissions/repos/access that it's parent does... But everyone does think about things differently! What's your use case for wanting to not be told about repos that are accessible via inheritance? You should definitely leave your feedback for the github API team on the developer site!,,,,,,
426955461,1882,Issue,"What's your use case for wanting to not be told about repos that are accessible via inheritance?My recent task was to update a set of repos in selected child teams only. I just realized that I updated not only child team repos, but repos from the parent team. Hopefully, that did not brought any side effects, I just spend more time on that.One noticeable thing about repos in inherited teams is that when you use a site to explore nested team repos, you can not distinguish repos in a child team from repos in parent team.Our org structure has some top-level teams with a bunch of repos in it and smaller child teams with repos too.So, when you navigate to a child team you can see more than 100 repos combined in a single list. It's hard to understand the real structure of the teams content.You should definitely leave your feedback for the github API team on the developer site!I already emailed them several times about it and other Teams API bugs.",,,,,,

The `push` event that we already have, is from the events API activity stream calls, whereas the `push` event you want is from a webhook.  We currently dont have any code to directly handle a webhook, however if you create the response class you can still use our deserializer to pass the json payload to, and populate the response model.As a first step can you create the response models and push them up?

Hopefully I did it right.All the new `PushWebhook*` classes are here, but now I need to deserialize them, and I don't know how to distinguish between the `PushWebhookEvent` payload and the `PushEvent` payload in `SimpleJsonSerializer.cs` in the `GetPayloadType(string activityType)` method.Can you review it please and try to help me figure it out?",,,,,,
408857000,1844,Issue,"In terms of the deserializer code, you might be getting hung up on some of the magic that is in there, for the events API endpoints (but that doesn't have any bearing on what you're trying to do with webhooks).  The magic stuff is to handle `Activity` responses, which have a `Payload` property of type `ActivtyPayload` with some special deserializer code that actually deserializes these as the derived classes.  For a basic webhook, you won't use any of that stuff though... you would have your own API/webserver which receives the webhook.  You would check the `X-GitHub-Event` http header, and based on the value you would know what webhook type it is and thus what webhook payload type to use.  Then you would call the octokit deserializer, and provide the actual class you want to deserialize into.  EgThis is the bare bones way to do it... I'm keen to think about how we could add some helpers to the library to make it easier.  The problem is it's not possible to at runtime dynamically deserialize the payload into a specific response type, that the user can know at compile time.  We can do the ugly trick like we do with the event APIs, where the user only gets a base class, which the deserializer has populated with an inheritted/derived class, but the user has to somehow know this, and cast it to the correct type, but I really dont like that.  Another way I was thinking we could do it, is by allowing the user to register their delegate code for the given types they care about, and we could then run that.  This has the advantage of being strongly typed at compile time.  It might look something like this:Now whether this stuff would belong in this core library or in an addon package `Octokit.Webhooks` Im still on the fence about.  I'd actually love to provide some common middle ware type approach that could actually handle the webserver/listening part of things too, so that makes me lean towards a separate library to do this stuffBut in terms of this PR I think we can just get the response models defined, and see if you can confirm that the first code sample I provided (using the Octokit deserializer directly) is working for you.

400167421,1832,Issue,"Can you provide a small example of what you mean, as I'm not seeing how ""marking all methods as virtual"" really helps you that much, as then you would have to implement basically everything yourself. You already can use your own `HttpClient` with octokit - so that would be one place you could intercept and handle particular HTTP responses (such as throttling on rate limit exceptions, or automatically retrying).  There are also fantastic libraries such as [Polly] that would enable you to wrap existing octokit calls with policy handlers to retry or delay things.",,,,,,
400391306,1832,Issue,"Thanks for your prompt reply.Yes, you are right! I forgot that I can solve it using DelegatingHandler of HttpClient. I planned to do it using [Dynamic Proxies].Using my own HttpClient, means that I need to create a chain of _DelegatingHandlers_  to act appropriately based on Github's response. However, in this case, I need to have access to some of the ocktokit's classes which now have _internal_ modifiers and are not exposed to third-party bits.For example, in my own custom DelegatingHandler, I need to parse the raw http response and be able to extract the type of exceptions (RateLimitExceededException,LoginAttemptsExceededException,etc). However, since _Reponse_ class is _internal_ and _Connection.HandleErrors(IResponse)_ is _private_, i have to reimplement the logic which makes my solution unreliable. Because in this case I need to always make sure my implementation is always consistent with Github's future response format. I believe having access to some of the internal methods and classes of octokit, makes it possible for us to rely on its always consistent and tested codebase.",,,,,,

I'd prefer not to just make all these things public or virtual, however Im sure we could come up with something.  Eg do you only ever need to respond to exceptions?  If so, perhaps we can add a hook into the ""HandleErrors"" section, allowing you to respond differently to the various exceptions at that point.",,,,,,

In addition, timeouts and HTTP related errors happen before reaching the _HandleErrors_ method.I thought a lot about this matter and I came to this point that having a custom [DelegatingHandler], maybe is the most practical way to achieve retry-able actions.",,,,,,

399752419,1825,Issue,"Hmm... I believe that endpoint requires being authenticated as a user, and you are not a user, you are an installation of a GitHub App.  When the app is installed by the user, they choose which repositories it can access (pick from a list, or choose ""All"").

So far we have implemented the basic GitHubApp support such as authentication, listing installations and the various core response models...

397958321,1817,Issue,"I've been wondering about these things too.Given we already have a `netstandard1.1` target, according to the [.NET Standard compatibility matrix], this alone should already be usable by .NET Framework 4.5 (as long as you use .NET Core SDK 2+ tooling).  So do we even need a `net45` target anymore in the first place?  I also wonder, if we have the `net45` target for people that somehow cant get off that framework, then is it ""just as difficult"" for them to move to 4.5.2 as it would be to 4.6+ (in other words is their issue that making ANY changes is not possible)?  Can you share your use case and project frameworks/versions etc and what restrictions you are operating in?  Also can you see any reason why you wouldnt be able to use the `netstandard1.1` target, and whether that would work in VSCode?",,,,,,
397974059,1817,Issue,"The issue at hand is `` referencing net45 in a target framework will fail builds if you don't have the targeting pack installed, which isn't available. Using netstandard1.1 does work fine, but the package vs framework proliferation is a little ugly honestly, it would look like you are installing a ton of dependencies, but they are just framework redirects. For that reason I have been targeting 452 explicitly in my packages, but that causes yet another issue, but one I think you have avoided by targeting so low, but useful info anyway: framework prefers framework, so even on 472 the 45(2) dll will be chosen over any compatible netstandard version. Leads to issues where you may use polyfills for lower framework versions, but desire to use built-in stuff in higher (AsyncLocal for instance). So, then you have to target a higher framework version too.Also, there is this consideration, semi-related since we are talking about targeting:![tweet]All said my pattern has been: ``  where 4X is the highest framework I would LIKE features from, to omit polyfills if necessary.",,,,,,
397974656,1817,Issue,Issue #1745 from January is a pretty prime example of the hassle.,,,,,,
398012093,1817,Issue,"hmmm so to unpack what you're saying, a full framework app will choose the highest available full framework target but wont ever use a netstandard target even if one exists at a ""higher"" feature level than the full framework option?  Eg a net472 app choosing a net45 version rather than netstandard2.0? yeeshWhy then wouldnt we actually prefer to only support netstandard1.x and 2.0 and drop net45/452 entirely?  Is it just the ""ugliness"" of all the included dependencies?  If we had to trade that off against people using later frameworks never being able to tap into the netstandard targets, Im tempted to just do netstandard only?Is the following the justification you were thinking, as to why you are including each target?net452 - provide an option for people on ""legacy"" full framework but prefer the supported 4.5.2 option as well as having a targetting pack available allowing use of vscode etcnet4X - fuller framework offering to not need to use polyfills, full framework apps will prefer this over the net452 target if they can use itnetstandard1.1 - low netstandard offering, based on compatibility matrix would provide an option for things like netoreapp1.0, mono 4.6, xamarin IOS/android/Mac versions prior to the latest and greatest etc (although all of these could also use up to netstandard1.6 so why the 1.1 - the main difference between 1.1 and 1.6 seems to be full framework 4.5/4.5.1/4.6 but you highlighted above that a full framework app would never consume a netstandard library if it also had a netXX option in the same package)?netstandard2.0 - re-baselining on the fuller API surface as per 's comment above edit: updated based on more thinking/reading",,,,,,
398249899,1817,Issue,"Yeah that my understanding for the most part. Only the netstandard2.0 piece is a little confusing. I think you edited to match my understanding, but it is as such: netstandard2.0 targets net46+ on the framework side, so if you were only targeting that already in say netstandard1.6 then just re-baseline on 2.0 instead, BUT if you targeted lower, then include both.So the end result is netstandard1.1;netstandard2.0. What I'm not sure about is: does the framework preference issue apply when checking for nuget package updates? If so it could lead to a scenario where clients don't get new package versions until they uninstall and reinstall the package. This is probably worth a test...",,,,,,

And should keep our `netstandard1.1` target since that's the only way people on earlier Mono/Xamarin and .NET Core 1.x can access the library?Assuming yes, then I guess the result of this Issue discussion is that we should change our current target frameworks (`net45,netstandard1.1`) to `net452,netstandard1.1,netstandard2.0` instead",,,,,,

One of the personal accounts was the token issuer that i was using to access the and update the issues. More specifically  i was trying to edit the description of the organizational account's issues, through the personal account's token. Although the personal account had almost all scopes checked, the permissions for the organizational's repos were all read only! So even though i could edit and update any issues that i was creating through the personal account's token i couldn't edit existing issues from the organization. We had a couple of solutions around  this.1.One of them was to change the role of the personal account inside the organization. but that was rejected since it gave great control to the account and that was not desired from the organization's part. I can't blame them!2.The other solution was to change the repository's default default member permissions.That was rejected too because that would give all the collaborators the power to edit issues except from the personal account whose token i was using.So because non of the above solution was secure proof a third suggestion was put on the table. For each repo ,that the personal account i was using needed write access, would change the default repo permission for my account.Now i had already thought about that and for me that would be the best scenario too, but the thing is that there are more than 1400 repos that my account would need write access. That means that unless we do it through the git api, some pure fellow will have to go inside each and every repo and change permissions! We still haven't decided.

387380062,1801,Issue,"Thanks  for jumping on this so quickly... this is an awesome feature and we are very keen to get it implemented in octokit.net 😀 I just had a quick 👀at this stage, I should have some more time over the weekend, but here is what jumped out immediately:- ""List"" methods should be named `GetAllForReference` and `GetAllForCheckSuite`- The annotations shouldnt be in a separate client as we structure our clients based on the API doc structure, so in this case there would be a top level `IChecksClient` with sub clients of `ICheckRunsClient` and `ICheckSuitesClient`.   Annotations would just be methods such as `ICheckRunsClient.GetAllAnnotations`- We will need to expand our `GitHubApp` permission class to contain the new `check` permission- A lot of `sealed` and `internal` classes which should just be `public`- You forgot to include the `AcceptHeaders.ChecksApiPreview` in all the `ApiConnection` calls 😀 - Watch out for the URI's as the owner/repo ones are `repos/:owner/:repo/etc` whilst the repository ID ones are `repositories/:id/etc` (you currently have `/repositories/` for all)",,,,,,
387953985,1801,Issue,"there's alot to review here, would be better to focus on one client at a time, and ensure unit tests and integration tests are passing 😉 A couple of other consistency things:- to maintain consistency with other clients, can we list the `owner`/`repo` version of a method first, then the `repository_id` version?  This is because we are POC'ing some code generation tools so consistent ordering is going to be important- similary, the naming convention for clients is that the class name is plural (which you've done, eg `IGitHubCheckRunsClient`) but the accessor method is singular.  so in terms of usage, we should be `github.Check.Run.GetAllForReference()` rather than `github.Checks.Runs.GetAllForReference()`",,,,,,

383891912,1798,Issue,"In terms of the latter 2 I think it will be fine to just add the base ctor to the existing one, and all of the existing parameters that go with it. After all, these ctor really are only useful for creating mock responses, our deserializer uses the parameter less one, and the protected setter properties so the blast radius is pretty small on these and I like the idea of enforcing the convention that all fields could be mockedI'm terms of the first 2 I'm thinking the best approach is to add an attribute but rather than suppressing the whole test, the attribute could take a parameter of field names to be exempt. That way we can still enforce the other fields are present, but exempt the Account Type field since it's not valid to create an Organization with any other typeSound good?",,,,,,

379913435,1792,Issue,"I'm a bit hesitant to include things like this in the core library, as we try to keep it as much of a lightweight wrapper around the upstream GitHub api as possible.  This is why we don't have ""composite"" actions (involving multiple API calls) or built in caching.  I think it's difficult to match the different use cases and expectations of users when you start doing things like this.  Particularly in this example, it could end up ""sleeping"" for almost an hour.  (I'm also questioning why it has a hardcoded 1 second sleep, after any response is received?)   Thanks for sharing though, and we can keep this here as an example for anyone wanting to know how they could wrap calls to automatically handle rate limit or abuse retries.  One thing I've been thinking about, is creating a separate NuGet package for `Octokit.Extensions` that could include more of these additional helpers, without having them in the ""officially supported"" library...",,,,,,

Thus my recommendation. My concern is that if there was a ""magic"" wrapper that helped people wait out the rate limit then they are even less likely to know what they are doing (or the potential impact they may be causing).  We'd then have people thinking that ""octokit took 30 minutes to execute a simple query"" and things like that 😮 I'd definitely be for improving any documentation that wasn't clear in how things work, although I did think we specifically called out how rate limiting works and highlighted the fact that you need to use authenticated requests if you want to be given the more generous rate limits from GitHub. The ""1 second"" is from some of the documentation as a recommendation. If it can be removed, I'll remove it from the post so others don't include it if they reuse it.Did you have a link to this?

I'm just looking for ways to keep others from hitting the problems I did and having to spend all the time wading through the docs to get a workable solution.Again, I think things like this really fall out of the domain of an API wrapper... there are so many different ways people may want to implement queuing, rate limit handling or caching, we don't really want the additional complexity in this library.

GitHubApps also can only access a selected subset of endpoints",,,,,,
369107550,1775,Issue,"-irl the Octokit libraries don't really care about the _source_ of the token, as it will always send `Authorization: Token {token}` when making requests.

I strongly suspect that the delay will be at GitHub themselves rather than Octokit. Are you unwittingly pulling a large volume of data?I've experienced rather lengthy delays myself on some things like getting all branches that meet some compare condition with another branch, that requires a compare operation on each branch and these seem to take some time. (like 45 seconds for like 30 odd branches).Also note - I can see that GetAll( ) has overloads which take a ApiOptions object, seems you can get the data back as a number of ""pages"" and specify the size of each page. This may enable you to get say a few back at a time and display these or whatever as the results come back rather than waiting and doing nothing while the whole set is transferred.Out of curiosity, how many items are returned for these lengthy operations?You could write some helper code that encapsulates that paging and perhaps uses a page size of say 20 yet **yield return** each item one at a time. This way the caller would see what seems like a continuous set of results but in reality they are being pulled 20 at a time in quick succession.Perhaps Octokit itself already provides a ""paging-set to IEnumerable"" helper somewhere...",,,,,,
368638663,1774,Issue,"Okay, but being stuck on the await to complete for 10+ minutes kinda kills the point of using this library for me. the default behaviour of `GetAll` is to follow pagination hints and fetch **all** records related to an API.

369243480,1774,Issue,"- Hi,I was curious about how I'd implement an alternative ""GetAll"" into Octokit, I can see it's defined deep down as a member of the `IApiConnection `class. What I was curious about is implementing an alternative that returns` IEnumerable` and under the hood uses pagination to get pages ""on demand"", this is a pattern I've used before with other REST services.In that pattern I simply get the first page, then do something like this:I'm sure you get the idea, the big question I have for you is how to introduce this without breaking existing consumers of the interface `IApiConnection`.This patterns only goes to the network to get more items as and when the caller is enumerating items and there are no more items left in the ""current"" page. So if caller was enumerating something likeThen only as many network calls as are necessary would be made to get the first matching 20 items and no more, this is a potentially huge saving for certain kinds of data extraction.",,,,,,
369410558,1774,Issue,"the first issue that I can see is that most of the `GetAll` APIs return `Task`, so I'm not sure how a drop-in replacement would work when that signature needs to change.

369432509,1774,Issue,"- OK yes, that's true - very interesting to explore options here and yes - lazy loading - is exactly the term I was seeking!",,,,,,
369612668,1774,Issue,- Would the team here regard a change to `IApiPagination` a breaking change? The interface is public but seems to perform a purely internal role. I'm considering a small change to the definition of `GetAllPages `that could (I think) make it straightforward to introduce lazy pagination with zero changes to consumers of Octokit.,,,,,,
369751676,1774,Issue,"From your original issue text )reading via email) I was wondering if you werent aware we had the `ApiOptions` pagination settings, and users already can write a loop that retrieves each page one by one as they need them (you can also generally specify a larger ItemsPerPage value than the default eg default might be 20 but you can often request 100 per page).  But after your edits and further discussion it seems you just want this to be more abstracted away from the user and effectively to stream chunks of records to the user as they enumerate through the collection?  Isn't that what the Reactive `IObservable` stuff is meant for?In any case, feel free to play around with whatever implementation you like and put up a PR for discussion/feels...  We do try to avoid breaking changes but we can figure that part out once there is an actual ""better"" implementation to consider",,,,,,
369785407,1774,Issue,"- Hi, yes you may be correct and its better to leverage IObservable than implement a lazy paging mechanism. I've not really done much with IObservable and need to devote some time to it. So far as the paging goes, yes I did see `ApiOptions `and was considering making start page zero (0) act as a sentinel so the underlying logic in Octokit could detect that value and then do the lazy paging, but that all depends on whether changing the signature of the method in `IApiPagination `would be regarded as a breaking change or not.If that signature _could_ be tweaked I think I have a rather neat way of adding this lazy paging while maintaining the integrity of all other existing interfaces.I can't imagine any scenario where a consumer of Octokit would need to ever access `IApiPagination` because it seems to be of purely internal significance.I may just play with this when I get some time and show you guys what I end up with just out of academic interest.",,,,,,
369817627,1774,Issue,"I've not really done much with IObservable and need to devote some time to it. IObservable is a push-based way of enumerating values, which is a bit different to what you had in mind. So I'm going to share some reservations of mine about this change, and provide some hints as to where you should be looking.I'm quietly worried about breaking the _behaviour_ of `GetAll` here to achieve lazy loading (because it's there in the name - _Get_ _All_) and `IEnumerable` is basically a synchronous interface (`MoveNext()` does block, so if you're going to make a network request when you need a new page it's still not going to be a great experience for the consumer).I'd recommend instead looking at [`IAsyncEnumerable`] and in particular [`IAsyncEnumerator`] which is part of Ix.NET.The signature for IAsyncEnumerator is much closer to what you are looking for in terms of an asynchronous enumerable:There's been very early discussions about making this a part of the BCL and supporting the ability to `foreach` over these like you would a regular `IEnumerable`, but I'm not involved with them at all so you'll have to keep up with Mads Torgensen et al and future C# language features.",,,,,,
369926722,1774,Issue,"- Thanks for the additional info on `IObservable`, much appreciated. Also just to be very clear I was not suggesting any change to `GetAll `only the method signature in `IApiPagination`, no other existing public interface or method signature would change.I created a system last year that used T4 templates along with a method defintion XML file to generate a client class around a REST service (which has hundreds of JSON classes and hundreds of endpoints).In that design some methods in the XML get generated as TWO methods in the generated client class(es), these were paginated methods similar what I see in Octokit. When the T4 translated such a method is created a paged based conventional method where caller can enumerate the pages easily and another method (name had 'Seq' appended, an F# convention) which did something like this, internally enumerates pages and yield returns each item.It's particularly useful for scenarios where the caller is doing a` .First()` or `.Take()` operation because the caller is unaware of the pagination and the system pulls only as many pages as are required to satisfy the .First() or .Take() if the caller really does want all pages ""at once"" then `.ToList()` gives them that.So if I did spend any time here on this (and I'm more academically interested in how I'd do it than anything else) the only existing public interface that I think I'd need to change is the method signature in` IApiPagination `which I suspects is of no interest to any Octokit consumers (I may be wrong of course).On a very separate topic I'm developing a system to pull data in various ways from GitHub and I think you'd urge me to leverage the reactive version of Octokit here, is that true? If so is there anything missing from the current reactive version that's present in the ordinary version? The consumer in this case will be a .Net Core Web App by the way.Thanks",,,,,,

365533313,1762,Issue,Final thought... Because we try to have immutable response classes all the parameters have protected setters and the only way to create them is via a constructor... so I wouldn't think normal desetializers like newtonsoft would be able to instantiate our objects (unless it handles classes where only the constructor can be used)?

I'm trying to change its default behaviour to be more like an enum value type (ie default to default(T)) and make it no longer accept nulls in the ctor but I'm now worried how many response models might then blow up because they should really have been made nullable `StringEnum?`",,,,,,

Therefore a file doesnt necessarily constitute an ""Ahead"" or ""Behind"" change.There is however a `Status` field on each file which indicates whether it is added, removed, edited, in conflict etc... is that more what you wanted?

When running the octokit build script it downloads the 1.0.1 runtime into the local `.dotnet` directory and everything proceeds to work fine.  In order to support the `netcoreapp1.0` for AWS Lambda, we did have to use an `ImplicitMetaPackageReference` setting in the csproj files to stop the build tooling automatically going up to a 1.1 equivalent.

360320830,1747,Issue,It's funny because I think technically any later sdk could build the projects but in order to execute the test projects (netcoreapp1.0) you need the specific runtime.

Perhaps appending this accepts header onto EVERY call we make, in the `Connection.SendDataInternal()` method (that every call ultimately routes through) could be an option.  This means it's provided on every call and also means unit tests don't need adjusting (because they are testing against the higher level `Connection` methods).  A quick hack doing this shows only 3 unit tests that will need adjusting...In my previous experience with GitHub API I haven't seen issues when sending accepts headers to calls which don't actually want them (they just appear to be ignored) but I suppose there is some level of risk in doing this on *EVERY CALL*  what do you think about the risk (or otherwise) of sending the `jean-grey` header on *all* API calls?",,,,,,

365887520,1741,Issue,"Just to loop back on this one, there are some fundamental differences between octokit.net being a c# based ""object oriented"" implementation, vs octokit/js being more dynamic that come into play here.  On the javascript side, you can give users control over preview headers if you want, and simply return them back the dynamic json responses without strong typing (assuming even if you wanted to provide typescript typings for the responses, you wouldnt easily be able to support different types of responses (eg Repository and RepositoryWithLicensePreviewEnabled)?Meanwhile on the c# side here, we are deserializing API responses into explicit response objects that are strongly typed.  This means octokit.net itself pretty much needs to decide if we will enable a preview feature and modify the response object accordingly or not.  It's not really something that could easily be made opt in/out.  In theory for the ones that simply add a field, we could allow opting out of it, and the response object would just have a `null` for the new field.  But sometimes preview features actually change the shape of the response, and we wouldnt be able to support old and new in an elegant way.In general i think the user base is pretty happy to be ever marching forward, and supporting whatever preview functions come along with the ride 😁 What I was specifically getting at with looping a few other people into this conversation was my thoughts that to easily implement the graphQL node id on sooo many calls, it would be good if we simply used the preview header on all requests (even those that technically dont support it).  Given the upstream API ignores preview headers that arent relevant to it, this seemed like a pretty pragmatic approach to implement this approach without requiring huge code changes (which would then get reverted when the API is no longer in preview).",,,,,,

357230181,1740,Issue,I'd recommend `GetAllForRepository` but also: - using the pagination API so you get more results per page: - using a local cache for past review comments and only querying for values since the most recent stored entry,,,,,,
357254844,1740,Issue,"Thanks for your prompt reply. In some repositories, because of a large amount of data, even using pagination with big page sizes won't solve the above problem. besides that, I'm working on a research that I need to fetch all of the review related information from top repositories to analyze them afterward, so practically the second solution is not suitable for my scenario.",,,,,,
357259899,1740,Issue,"I would still recommend investing in a backing store (like a database) so that you can easily store the PR comments and work with them locally, so you can research as many repositories as desired while working within the API limits. The 5000 requests/hr limit is a server-side restriction of the GitHub API, and the Octokit client is not able to circumvent this.",,,,,,
357297235,1740,Issue,", Of course, I'm using a backing store to save data. However, storing is a different concern from fetching data from servers. The problem is that practically GetAllForRepository is useless in scenarios where you need more than 5000 requests to fetch all of the data. A mitigation to this could be a change in GetAllForRepository to wait for a sufficient amount of time, in case of reaching the limit. And, automatically starting to fetch data again after that.",,,,,,
357302348,1740,Issue,"A mitigation to this could be a change in GetAllForRepository to wait for a sufficient amount of time, in case of reaching the limit. And, automatically starting to fetch data again after that.I'll defer to  on this from an earlier thread:  we generally shy away from implementing higher order logic like making composite/multiple API calls on behalf of the consumer, or building in retry/throttling type behaviour in the library itself, because there are too many potential use cases to implement in a way that would suit everyone.[The rate limiting API is available in Octokit.net, so that callers can handle this themselves].",,,,,,
357412738,1740,Issue,"The problem with the current API is that when I call GetAllForRepository then I have no way to control its behavior by myself. Because when GetAllForRepository is running I don't have any access to GetLastApiInfo() method via events or callbacks. I should wait till I catch the Rate Limit Exceeded exception and act accordingly.I'm really sorry to bother, your API is really awesome and I just wanted to make a contribution to improve it, based on the experience I had with it.",,,,,,
357424973,1740,Issue,"Because when GetAllForRepository is running I don't have any access to GetLastApiInfo() method via events or callbacksThe `GetAllXXX()` methods will all have an override that takes an `ApiOptions` parameter, that allows you to specify the `StartPage` (amongst other pagination settings).  When you don't pass an `ApiOptions` to the call, octokit automatically retrieves all pages for you, which sounds like where you are going to run into trouble on large repositories.But you can easily control this yourself by writing your own loop that uses `ApiOptions` to get 1 page, then check your remaining rate limit and either delay or go around the loop again.",,,,,,

361919961,1738,Issue,"Back to the topic of this PR I was just checking out the [API docs] for the GitHub Apps implementation and it looks like we have a bit of reworking to do of the structure and naming of things.  Apologies for not noticing this sooner, and I appreciate you had picked up another PR that had already set this direciton... but it's important that we have consistency with the official docs and the upstream API we are wrapping, as well as consistency across the code base in terms of naming things and structure.  Feel free to let me know if you aren't keen to make these changes, and I can take over instead :+1:We want to match the octokit structure to the API doc structure, so given the docs are like this:We shouldn't really have `GitHubClient.Application` and `GitHubClient.Installation` both at that top level (the `Installation` should be a child of `Application`).   Also instead of `Application` it should be named `GitHubApp` (as a property) and `GitHubAppsClient` (class name) so we match the terminology of the API docs as well.Infact looking at it more, that whole ""Installations"" area is actually a different set of API calls that are used once you are authenticated as a GitHubApp installation (same as the ""Marketplace"" area)...The calls being implemented in this pull request are [get the authenticated github app][create new installation token][list installations for user] all of which actually live in the ""GitHubApps"" section (not in the ""Installations"" section or in an ""Access Tokens"" section).  This is all rather confusing but appears to be the way it is in the official upstream API 🤔 So what I actually think we need to do is- delete the `InstallationsClient` and `AccessTokensClient` classes- rename `ApplicationsClient` to `GitHubAppsClient` - implement all 3 methods in `GitHubAppsClient` using consistent octokit method naming which would be called   - `GetCurrent()`  - `CreateInstallationToken()`  - `GetAllInstallationsForCurrent()`",,,,,,

A few things I noticed- `Application` response model already exists from years ago and is being re-used here, but doesnt have all of the fields of the actual response object and also has a `Url` field which doesnt map.  We may have to create a new `GitHubApp` response model for this stuff- We probably need to implement more of the endpoints such as `Get` for an app, `GetInstallation` for an installation and `GetAllForUser` in order to support GitHubApp stuff enough to be useful to end users?- XmlDocument tags on the clients and response model fields will be necessary to provide intellisense guidance to users- Integration tests - we need to figure out how/if we can flesh out our integration test framework to handle doing these calls as a GitHubApp- Some of the endpoints (such as list installations or generate installation token) require being authenticated as the GitHubApp which means we have to do the FWT token stuff and so on, we might need to think about whether we provide helper methods around this or just expect the consumers to have created the JWT from their app's certificate etc already",,,,,,

I did try to add XML comments to all new methods, so please tell me if I missed anything.Regarding the more complete implementation and some solution around JWT tokens - up until I started writing this feature it was not implemented at all (no JWT token, I don't know what FWT token is), so I think users get at least something which allows them to start writing extensions, don't you agree?I already use it in code that is going to be integrated into production soon, and I don't think there'll be too big a change after the fixes you request, if any.Please tell me what you think.",,,,,,

356096800,1734,Issue,"The github API returns sparser results for ""GetAll"" type queries, so you might need to load each PR individually to have all fields fully populated.Once you have the list from your search query, try loading each one with `PullRequest.Get()` and check if the fields have the data you want?If you check out my [Octokit.ReleaseNotes] project there is an example of taking a list of PR's and loading all the details about them in parallel which might be useful for you [here]",,,,,,
356699085,1734,Issue,"Great, i'll check it out. Thanks for the detailed response. I think it'd be great if there was a way of specifying a fuller return data structure, or even a batch 'fully populate' command, but I'm sure I can work around it with the code you've pasted. Thanks again!",,,,,,
356912196,1734,Issue,"We try to keep Octokit as an API wrapper that reflects the upstream GitHub API structure and calls, so since the upstream API doesn't have a mechanism to flag that you want ""fully populated"" responses in ""Get All"" type requests (presumably for performance reasons), it's not really something that would be implemented in Octokit either.Note, the successor to the v3 REST API is the [v4 GraphQL API] and GraphQL allows more control over specifying exactly what fields you want returned in responses etc.  This isnt something we support in Octokit today but is something we are looking at (you of course could talk to it with your own code or another library though)",,,,,,

337470604,1693,Issue,"Thanks  !Any reason why you've gone with an extra function call rather than adding a parameter to the constructors?  In your usage would you only set this larger timeout value right before you do an assett upload, and then reset it again for other calls, or would you set the timeout once globally and have all calls use the larger timeout value?",,,,,,
337479843,1693,Issue,"Any reason why you've gone with an extra function call rather than adding a parameter to the constructors? [...] You guessed right. In the fix I made, I just hardcoded the timeout value to fulfil our needs that was just uploading an asset ;-)But but because that is a library, we can't enforce a use that will not fit to every use. Timeouts could be useful.So, indeed, I provide this method to be able to change it just before uploading an asset (and set it back to a normal value just after).But you are right, I can also add an optional parameter to the constructor to make it more convenient to use. I will do it.",,,,,,

337812372,1693,Issue,"Yeah the constructors are a bit messy... I agree perhaps leave it to the discrete method call.  Since it is more likely people would change timeout only when uploading a large asset, then change timeout back again afterwards, this should be ok",,,,,,

It would be nice if I could batch requests to the API, or if more information came back on certain calls (like having Reviews come back as part of a PR request), but until the API supports it I'll have to live with what I have.",,,,,,

I'll flick through the particular calls and double check.In terms of your comment about needing to make so many API calls, yes indeed it is the case with REST APIs but the good news is that GitHub have a [GraphQL API] available in preview, which is an entirely different paradigm and allows you to make single requests grabbing graphs of information (eg pull requests meeting some criteria, with user comment and commit details, but only the fields you want instead of the entire objects etc) rather than lots and lots of REST calls.

335363693,1683,Issue,"Looking into this a bit more I think it's because my calling application is running various tasks in parallel - it must be hitting a timing issue with the `Dictionary _cachedEnums` from `GitHubSerializerStrategy` of which we have a static instance in `SimpleJsonSerializer`!  `static readonly GitHubSerializerStrategy _serializationStrategy = new GitHubSerializerStrategy();` thus making it not threadsafe.Tracing through the code, `if (_cachedEnums[type].ContainsKey(value))` is returning `false` but when it then attempts to `_cachedEnums[type].Add(value, parsed);` it throws the exception that the key already esxists (another thread has just put it in there).It seems an easy fix would be to change `_cachedEnums`to the `ThreadsafeDictionary` helper class like other parts of `SimpleJson` are using (or we could use the framework's `ConcurrentDictionary`)",,,,,,

360039552,1683,Issue,Yep it doesn't matter which endpoints as it's related to the internals of the deserializer class.

The proper fix is to implement thread safe dictionaries which I hope to get to when I have a chance (but PR's are very much welcome as well! 😀 ),,,,,,
360285576,1683,Issue,"I'm game for a PR. My instinct is to use the `ConcurrentDictionary` class to handle this. I also think the cache will need to use thread-safe dictionaries as it's values since those sub-dictionaries are also potentially accessed concurrently.Let me know if you think I should be using `ReflectionUtils.ThreadSafeDictionary` instead. It looks like it's optimized for computing new values for a specific key on get misses. It appears it assumes that every key has one corresponding correct value that can be computed by a delegate (I.e., a dictionary that maps types to their constructor - a given type has a specific constructor).

See [the `octokitnet-test` organisation] and [the specific PR] we use for these tests.This change means that the state sharing between tests doesn't happen as much as the `GetAll` method would have been the one benefit from it the most, as we have 6 test methods for it.We still take advantage of it, though, but only in [one place].More than happy to get feedback on this.The whole thing feels somewhat over-engineered with the abstract class, so feel free to bounce ideas around!",,,,,,

320434587,1647,Issue,"After a bit of research, it looks like using `dotnet test` against `net452` when using mono is not supported for now: A possible workaround is to change the Cake process so that the tests are run only against `netcoreapp1.0` when not on Windows.What do you think ?",,,,,,
320435244,1647,Issue,"Yep I'd been researching this on and off today too and had come across the same item you linked. My thoughts were to work around it as you say, by not running net45 2 targeted tests on non windows platforms",,,,,,

355399032,1646,Issue,Just noting that `StatusEvent` will be implemented in #1732 once merged,,,,,,
319852232,1645,Issue,Actually I just realised that there are [unit tests here] covering each of the payload deserialization (using hardcoded json responses) so im not sure if we need the integration tests or not.  On the one hand they are useful since there's no telling whether the upstream API responses may look different to the hardcoded test fixtures but the rarer events do pose a problem in finding them within the 300 events/90day limits on the GitHub events API,,,,,,
319852267,1645,Issue,"would appreciate your thoughts on this from an implementation POV would this workaround be useful to you, given you had raised #1635 covering the `DeleteEvent` payload being unsupported currently?",,,,,,

Given how specific the deserializer rules are (eg mapping ruby/snake case to c# camel case, using our `[Property]` attribute on members or enums to determine the API field mappings etc...  The class has to be ""just right"" and if someone was going to go to that effort it would be preferable they send a PR to add the model officially so everyone can use it?That said I do still like the idea not so that people can BYO response class but more so because it could provide a bit more discoverability and compile time guidance than we currently have.Eg currently you just ""have to know"" that you can cast the Payload to another type via `activity.Payload as PulRequestEventPayload` but there is no evidence you can do this, and no indication on what type you should use.Whereas if we implemented a method like `DeserializeAs() where T: ActivityPayload` users would hopefully disover the fact it can be deserialized AND get a compile time check that they are at least specifying a class that derives from `ActivityPayload`.  Im not sure if `ActivityPayload` itself should be a wrapper class, similar to the `StringEnum` you implemented  that contains the json string and can provide it as raw json or deserialized to a specific payload type, or whether we would just have a `DeserializePayloadAs` method on the `Activity` object itself.",,,,,,
320338540,1645,Issue,"Do you think there is a use case for consumers providing their own type?Yes, the use case is that there might be no official type for the payload yet, and you're blocked until next release. Isn't this what we're trying to fix? if someone was going to go to that effort it would be preferable they send a PR to add the model officially so everyone can use it?Yes, that would be preferable. But this will let them do the work and unblock themselves first, _then_ submit a PR :smile: currently you just ""have to know"" that you can cast the Payload to another type via `activity.Payload as PulRequestEventPayload` but there is no evidence you can do this, and no indication on what type you should use.What if it's a new payload type that doesn't have a type yet?

We don't control the payload types and new ones can be introduced at any moment. When that happens, users that want to handle that payload needs to wait for a new release (or, I guess, do the casting).Is this generic enough for a `Payload`? I'm om the phone, so don't have 100% control on the door of this thing...",,,,,,
320507733,1645,Issue,"Yes, this exactly what I need - then I can use something like JsonConvert in order to deserialize the object into my own DeleteEventPayload class which contains all the fields which I need to access.But what would be even better is not having to create this class at all, have Octokit deserialize into some kind of dynamic object instead, so that I can access its fields however I like.",,,,,,
320534078,1645,Issue,"We could return a `dynamic` object but I'm not a huge fan of them (and you could do that for yourself anyway from the json string if you want).

I figured the string json was the most flexible though",,,,,,
394048634,1645,Issue,"As a consumer of this library, literally anything than what is currently being done now would be preferable.

But Github confirmed that being able to see a commit that's only on a fork using a URL that targets the upstream is expected behaviour - at the browser/URL level anyway.I am forming the opinion that forks are nothing more than ""virtual views"" of a repo, for the forks made by John and Mary, all existing branches get cloned as (for example) Mary.master and John.master. Then Mary and John when perusing their forks are actually simply seeing their own branches but with the name prefix stripped away.So there really is only one repo and the appearance of forks as distinct repos is illusory, but this is just what I think I don't know for certain.",,,,,,

318802919,1636,Issue,"Yeah this would definitely be a cool feature to add!  According to [the docs] ""most API functions"" will support ETag and/or Last-Modified header... which can be specified in `If-NoneMatch` or `If-ModifiedSince` headers on requests, which will return `304 Not Modified` response rather than actual data, if no new content was present since the specified ETag/timestamp.The trick is, how to implement it gracefully!We currently expose the ETag (and can also add the LastModified field) header values via the exiting `GetLastApiInfo()` method, so we are essentially covered on that side of things...In terms of specifying the ETag or ModifiedSince values on requests in a broad/elegant way, we could think about adding support for these on our `ApiOptions` class which we currently use to specify pagination related settings.  The problem there is that only `GetAll` methods supported pagination so they were the only ones that had overloads added that take an `ApiOptions` parameter.  But I guess they are also the most important ones where you want to do ETag based efficient calls anyway.  If it was a single entity ""Get"" request there really isnt much benefit in using this kind of functionality - it's only the ""GetAll"" requests where it would be most useful...  do you agree with that reasoning?Things to think about- Should we support ETag and Last-Modified?  What happens if one is specified and the API doesnt support it - hopefully this results in an Api error with clear indication of the problem, I'd be happy to bubble that up to the user- Can we identify any candidates that are NOT `GetAll` type calls, that would be good to have this functionality on?  If so we might want to look at having a base ApiOptions that only supports these fields, and change what is currently `ApiOptions` to something like `ApiPaginationOptions` that inherits the base one and add the pagination fields.  That way we could use the base one on non GetAll functions- How should we behave when the 304 response is received?  Simply return empty collections?",,,,,,

Ideally this is where support for ETags would help because my API would be able to query the status of a check (noting the ETag) - evaluate a few conditions and then attempt to update the check providing the ETag. If the ETag had changed then I could get an error.Basically what I'm after is some kind of concurrency, ETag or upset mechanism.

309416804,1616,Issue,"Hi  Based on the discussion in #1243 I thought this will work.The discussion in #1243 actually mentions the following: One thing to pay attention to is that requesting a specific issue will not return the repository key.So it seems the upstream API response only includes the `Repository` information sometimes.  Im assuming the logic might be that the API doesn't lookup/include the `Repository` information, when you had to specify the repository in the API call in the first place.  eg when querying a single or multiple issues from a specified repository, I guess you ""already know"" what the repository is?Looking at the tests added in PR #1292 (the ""fix"" for #1243) it seems the only expected responses that do include `Repository` field are- `GetAllForCurrent()`- `GetAllForOwnedAndMemberRepositories()`- `GetAllForOrganization()`",,,,,,

So in terms of documentation there is [this page] but I don't feel like it would be that discoverable there... Perhaps the best way to note that this field is not always returned  is to add a note in the xmldoc comment [here] saying something like the field is only included on queries that span multiple repositories, or something similar.

It doesn't sound ""right"" that you'd have to strip things from the list though Looking at the API docs  I do see that there is a base_tree field that can be set to the sha of the tree you want to update, and we've implemented this `BaseTree` in `NewTree` request model. So rather than loop through the entire recursive tree and add them to a new tree, perhaps you can just have a new tree with the changes you wanted, and set it's BaseTree to the sha of the current tree, avoiding the need to include all the other things you didn't actually want to change... Did you try doing that at all? In terms of adding this kind of logic to octokit, currently we haven't provided accelerator/composite methods that make multiple API calls,  and are more focused on providing equivalence to the underlying API methods. So I'd say it's better to have a documented example of ""how to perform complex tasks with octokit"" but probably shy away from directly implementing such things. Happy to discuss though",,,,,,

This works great for additions (and I suspect update, but not tried).It doesn't however support delete.From the research I've done, I believe that to delete - the only method is to clone the entire existing tree (without setting the base tree).  And then either omit or remove the files you wish to delete from the NewTree before submitting it.If you see the comment in the API docs for the base_tree property - while not explicit in about how it should be used for deleting items, it does point in that direction.  And a few blog posts have backed that up.So yes, I would agree this seems a rather cumbersome approach - I believe it is the appropriate approach.  (although always happy to be proved wrong)",,,,,,
305932461,1610,Issue,Ah ok I didn't appreciate the fact that there's no way to delete something except to omit it from a whole new tree ! What's with needing to exclude anything of type Tree from the new tree though? Did you figure out why that's necessary?,,,,,,

However, when I looked at the commit on Github it showed as no changes had been made.Add that single line:And everything seems to be working.I suspect that having the Tree type in there is the equivalent of setting the base tree (I'd expect them to be same Tree ... not checked that though).  As such including the ""last"" Tree as an object in the list, I believe git is using that as it's base, then applying any additions or updates in the list (of which there are none).  The absence of a file in the list has no affect, as the removed file will have already been pulled in when it took the ""last"" tree.That last part is speculation on my part ;)",,,,,,
556042802,1610,Issue,Hi! Having the same problem as well so I used this as a workaround for now. Are there any plans to make it possible for the deletions to be done via git trees though?

298177709,1595,Issue,"Hmm so there are a few curve balls when actually running this... In our SimpleJsonSerializer we take care of converting github api values that contain hyphens or underscores into our C# enum values, for example `utf-8` in GitHub API is `Utf8` in Octokit, and `base_ref_changed` is `BaseRefChanged` so the current implementation fails in `ParsedValue` to parse enum values from strings that contain these characters.  Our deserializer also handles having properties added to enum values to allow us to customize what string representation a given enum value should have, for example in the Reaction API, we have api value of `+1` which maps to c# enum value of `Plus1`.  It's not nice to duplicate this ""API enum strategy"" code in both the `JsonSerializer` and the `StringEnum.ParseValue()` so I've rejigged the SimpleJsonSerializer to expose a `DeserializeEnum(string value, Type type)` function, that can now be used in both places.  Let me know what you think, Im about to push the commit up",,,,,,
298180544,1595,Issue,"I also found that in the implicit conversion of `TEnum` to `StringEnum` the ctor needed to serialize the passed in `TEnum` value to a string using our ""GitHub API strategy"" rather than just `ToString()` (so that we get the ""correct"" string value taking into account property mappings etc)... otherwise something like this was failing in Integration Tests:This is because when `ToString()` was used, the `StringEnum.Value` property was ""Plus1"" when it needs to be ""+1"" in order to match the true `StringEnum` as returned fro the API call (due to the custom `[Property(value=""+1"")]` attribute on those enum values, to map the GitHub api string to our eunm name).With the DeserializeEnum and SerializeEnum changes I've just pushed up, I now have a bunch of integration tests working without needing any code changes.Given the nature of these changes, I'll look at getting a full integration test run done as part of merging this PR (the CI builds dont run integration tests)",,,,,,

People would generally be interested in the parsed value, and not the string value. It makes sense to change the parsed value property to something shorter. What do you think?",,,,,,
299169709,1595,Issue,Yes I was thinking the same about having maybe `StringValue` and `Value`.  Although I do wonder if it's too much of a surprise for a property called `Value` to potentially throw an exception?,,,,,,
299179553,1595,Issue,"Although I do wonder if it's too much of a surprise for a property called Value to potentially throw an exception? Well, that's more or less what it does today, except it'll throw when deserializing. We've essentially deferred throwing to the call site.With this PR, the situation has improved, because the user can now use the `TryParse` method once they get an exception, without waiting for a new Octokit release with the new values.What we _really_ want. is steer people *away* from the `Value` (and `StringValue`) properties and over to the `TryParse` method. That's the only way the API will be ""future proof"" when new enum values are added. The question is; how do we accomplish that?",,,,,,
299190404,1595,Issue,"Yeah agree it's better than current explosions 😁 In terms of getting people over to using `TryParse` I guess the most we can do is update some doco/examples with some guidance (and perhaps write our integration tests that access enums in the same way we would expect others to access enums).The problem for me is that I personally find `out` vars a real ugly pain and feel like they hamper efforts to have clean/elegant code when you have to declare the variable on a separate line etc... but that is obviously the standard way c# handles these type of things currently (in c# 7 there is an inline `out var` option i believe, and of course tuples to think about, but for now it seems TryParse is the way to go, and at least people have an option in their own control to deal with unknown API response exceptions without having to wait for a new release that added the new enum members",,,,,,

299466232,1595,Issue,The only enum left is `Language`. It's pretty hairy and I'm thinking about just adding it to the ignore list for now. What do you think?Language probably shouldn't be an enum in the first place because enums are for (more or less) fixed sets. Languages are definitely not a fixed set 😛,,,,,,
299592365,1595,Issue,"❤️ Awesome pickups  on those enum values that have been incorrect forever 😛 So as I see it, now we have `[Parameter()]` attributes on all the enums so now we can take the bold step of removing the magic ""eat hyphens and underscores"" in the deserializer to truly cement this change and make sure we are obeying only the explicit parameter definitions.But in order to do this, literally EVERY response/request enum must have the attribute, so that means we either have to get `Language` done too, or we turn it into a string.  I guess from a search request perspective, we want to give users a helpful hand in letting them pick from nicely named languages, rather than needing to know the exact string/case the API wants, so I think there is value in providing it as an enum.  But Im thinking perhaps this would be a case where if we make it a StringEnum on the Rerquest model, users also have an option to provide a string value (if the API has a language we dont yet support)",,,,,,

296352978,1588,Issue,"In terms of more structural things, there are 2 main things i've spotted so far- With the response models, it looks like you are creating a `PullRequestReviewCreate` model for the return of this call, however my take on [the api docs] is that this call actually just returns a `PullRequest` object.  So in this case I don't believe we need a new response model, it should just use `PullRequest`.  However it looks like we DO need to include some new fields on the `PullRequest` model (namely the `IReadOnlyList RequestedReviewers` property).- There are usually ""undocumented"" api endpoints for each call that has a repository specified...  The traditional/documented calls are for owner and name, but there is usually another one taking the `long repositoryId` instead - refer #1120 for more details.  If you take a look at some other pull request related calls you should see the `repositoryId` based calls and what the ApiUrl formatting looks like.  As part of making this change we need to implement the `repositoryId` versions of these calls (unless for some reason it turns out they arent supported... the only way to tell is to probe the github api and see if they work!)",,,,,,

To do this we need to add the licenses preview API header (`AcceptHeaders.LicensesApiPreview`) in the underlying Http Get requests of those client calls (eg `client.Repository.Get(owner, repo)`) and then add a `License License` property to the `Repository` response class.Secondly there actually is a ""Get a repository's license"" call which you linked to.  This would be suitable as a new call in the `IRepositoriesClient` such as `Task GetLicenseContents();` and implement the `RepositoryLicense` response model (from the api doc it looks like this response may be different to the existing license responses)",,,,,,

My thinking has kind of come around to the fact that these are meant to be proper Url's so allowing people to pass ""any old string"" may not be great.  Thoughts?I also had a look at other places we use `Uri` type such as some helper functions or the `GitHubClient` itself, and I don't think any of those cases need to be turned to `string`.  So I guess pending a thought on whether Request models should or shouldn't be converted to `string` this should be good to merge.Also obviously this is a breaking change but I think just getting it in and flagging it in the release notes is preferable than waiting out 2 releases with the current properties marked `[Obsolete]` - given our pre 1.0 status I'm thinking that should be OK...",,,,,,

My thinking has kind of come around to the fact that these are meant to be proper Url's so allowing people to pass ""any old string"" may not be great. Thoughts?Yeah, I'm less into doing this for request models now because of how invalid input might be rejected - we're not doing anything explicit here with validating, but it's still a decent constraint to make callers follow.I can only see `NewCommitStatus` updated here -  how many would change here if we enforced `Uri` on the`*Url` request model properties?",,,,,,
295497641,1585,Issue,"Only 4 request models have `*Url` properties which are not `Uri`, so the change should be pretty quick and easy.One more thing; The current logic to get all the request models is to analyse all the parameters of all the methods on the client interfaces. It turns out that the [`Release`] response model is a parameter of the [`UploadAssetData`] method on `IReleasesClient`.That hasn't been a problem before since the tests always include the response models and we selectively choose if we want the request models.I see a couple of options available here: - a quick hack to exclude the `Release` type from the request model types - as it's done for [`IStatisticsClient`] - duplicate the `Release` type to make it a request model type. This would mean duplicate also the inner types.Any preference, or maybe another idea since I don't have the full picture?*Edit:*So the `UploadAssetData` method only uses the `UploadUrl` property of the `Release` object it takes as a parameter. If you want to be strict about request/response models separation, the method could take only the tokenized upload URL of the release instead of the whole object.",,,,,,

296163644,1585,Issue,Those few request models seem ok to me... I'd be interested in what currently happens if a user provides a string that is NOT a properly formatted Url for those properties... If the upstream API rejects it anyway then it's a no brainer to enforce the Uri on our side. If they are somehow allowed through then we'd need to think about whether we want to potentially prevent users from doing something they could be doing currently,,,,,,
296419748,1585,Issue,"Here's what I found out: - `AuthorizationUpdate.NoteUrl` and `NewAuthorization.NoteUrl` are both optional properties and will accept any `string`; I called the API endpoints with a value of `not a URL` and the calls succeeded - `NewCommitStatus.TargetUrl` needs to use the `https` scheme, but doesn't necessarily require a valid Uri; the API rejected `not a URL` but accepted `https://not a URL` - which will throw if used in `Uri` ctorI didn't know how to test the properties on `NewDeploymentStatus` as I couldn't figure how to create a deployment in the first place despite the [associated API documentation]",,,,,,
297186728,1585,Issue,"quick update on thisI played around with the deployment status API. and `NewDeploymentStatus.EnvironmentUrl` are only enforced to start with `https`, but can be invalid Uri - like `https://not a URL`.Going from there, I would suggest: - leaving `NoteUrl` on `AuthorizationUpdate` and `NewAuthorization` as `string` since the API will accept any value - leaving `TargetUrl` on `NewCommitStatus` as `string` since a valid Uri is not enforced - it just needs to start with `https` - leaving `LogUrl` and `EnvironmentUrl` of `NewDeploymentStatus` as `string` for the same reason as above",,,,,,

297677694,1585,Issue,"Since GitHub introduced the ""squash"" action directly when merging PR button ❤️ ❤️ I never bother to explicitly squash the branch anymore 😛 SO in terms of the Request models Im just trying to catch up here... did we end up with ANY of them needing to be `Uri` or did they all end up being `string` because the upstream api does accept non Uri's?  If there are no real examples of existing request models that must be Uri we probably shouldn't have the convention test since it would stand to reason that future api calls implemented would likely follow the same upstream behaviour (and thus we should use `string` rather than `Uri` in future too?)",,,,,,
297681754,1585,Issue,"Here's how it went: - After the convention test was created, 3 types were found having `string` properties - Calling the API endpoints associated with these types showed that they didn't need to be `Uri` as, well, the upstream API doesn't enforce valid URLs - The convention test was modified to add those 3 types as exceptionsIn other words, all the request model types but these three have `Uri` properties. I don't know the API well enough to determine if the other request model types should have `Uri` properties.",,,,,,
298155874,1585,Issue,"Thanks for the recap  .  So i pulled down your changes and played a bit and actually there are NO other Request models with Url properties except the ones you've excluded anyway.  So im thinking how about we actually change the test to ""RequestModelsHaveUrlPropertiesOfTypeString"" and enforce that we use strings for these.  Given that the only existing 4 request models with these properties are all accepted as strings upstream anyway it seems likely that future upstream API fields would be similar.",,,,,,
298156932,1585,Issue,"Haha,that's funny. I hadn't looked that closely. Thanks for that. Maybe the tests should only test types that do have `*Url` properties...Since it's only the excluded types, maybe we can go back to the scenario we had at some point with one convention test checking request and response model types at the same time? Would that work or would you prefer having two separate tests?",,,,,,
298157506,1585,Issue,"Maybe the tests should only test types that do have *Url properties...Yeah i guess at the moment the `MemberData` is all response types which does artificially inflate the test cases needlessly...  It's fine if you want to write a new function that only gets models that DO have the property that `EndsWith(""Url"")` if you want toSimilarly, it's fine if you want to combine back to one test case that does Request+Response models, or to leave it as is :+1:",,,,,,

If you could also fix up the [the other one] while you're at it, that would be swell!FYI there are also 40-50 matches of other code/methods where they check for a HTTP 204/404 for success only they dont use that handy `HttpResponse.IsTrue()` extension method :grinning:.

But that still requires their input.Alternatively, if the user can provide a personal access token you can use that for credentials and get a higher rate limit - however it's not associated with your application.",,,,,,
289922000,1572,Issue,Thanks for getting back Brendan. That's unfortunate.We are building a [chatbot] to interact with GitHub and were hoping it could scale to more than 60 queries per hour. Do you think creating a personal access key to be associated with the application so that it can have its higher rate limit would be a good idea?,,,,,,
289929517,1572,Issue,"Do you think creating a personal access key to be associated with the application so that it can have its higher rate limit would be a good idea?The OAuth token represents the relationship between a user and an application - that doesn't feel relevant here as it sounds like you don't need to have everyone authenticate against the application. Personal access tokens are great for testing and prototyping, but they are tied to a real account - combining whatever the real account has access to with [the scopes you give the token]. So there's a concept called ""machine accounts"" which I'll point out here. From the [Terms of Services] page: A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.What I'd do to simplify things without having to worry about OAuth: - create a machine account, add it as a member of your organization and give it access to the appropriate teams and repositories it needs to get stuff done - generate a personal access token for the machine account, ensuring it has just the appropriate scopes set that it needs - set that token `GitHubClient.Credentials` whenever your chatbot needs to interact with the GitHub APIIt avoids the whole OAuth application setup and management, but it doesn't sound like something you need here.",,,,,,

Do you mean to remove the obsoleted parameterless ctor in the `RepositoryUpdate`? Then we will have many changes on the tests, although it is quite straightforward and it's easy to change. It is also easier to check all of the diffs on the PR, therefore it's easier to review.2. Or we could do the otherwise, by changing the usages of all of parameterless ctor by replacing with ctor with 'name' parameter instead. Then we could mark the `ObsoleteAttribute` to always resolved as error instead of just compile warning, to really deprecate this constructor and to tell the consumer of this class to not to use it anymore. For example: `[Obsolete(""Please use the ctor RepositoryUpdate(string name) as Name is a required field"", true)]` (I prefer this solution 🙂 )Let me know what you think, I'll create a PR for any one of those.",,,,,,

Again, GitVersion does actually support running via `mono` but it could be that Cake doesn't handle this internally.

275891256,1555,Issue,"Yes, it will. the `increment: Minor` will increment the minor version by default, so after a tag `v0.24.0`, the next version will be `0.25.0`. Since we use `ContinuousDeployment`, a new version will be created after every commit, but the new version will affect the pre-release tag, not the minor.I hope this makes sense.",,,,,,
275891585,1555,Issue,"Yep, I'm guessing we have to tag the repo with -beta0001 in order for the next merge to master to get - beta0002 and so on? Not that it's a problem, just that we currently don't tag",,,,,,
275892076,1555,Issue,"Ah, sorry, I must not be clear enough.There's no need to tag the repo. The reason is that `ContinuousDeployment` always uses pre-release tags when it calculates a version. It will get the latest base version - most probably from a tag - then applies the increment specified - in our case Minor - then uses the specified pre-release tag so that each commit has a different version.The thing to keep in mind is that the increment will be applied only once between two tags, and the pre-release tag comes the config of the branch, not from a git tag.In our case: - `master`, tagged with `v0.24.0` - a PR is merged to `master`; the base version comes from the tag, it's `0.24.0`, the increment is Minor, so the new version is `0.25.0`. but as we use `ContinuousDeployment`, we apply the `beta` tag, so final version is `0.25.0-beta0001` - another PR is merged to `master`. all the steps from above are exactly the same, except the final version is `0.25.0-beta0002` because it's the second commit since the tag - another PR to `master`. same thing, version is now `0.25.0-beta0003`Does this make things clearer?",,,,,,
275892329,1555,Issue,"Ok yeah so I was wondering how it kept track of the 1,2,3 if there was nothing in the repo 😀  so it counts the commits, clever! Does that mean if a PR was merged instead of squashed (thus there might be 5 commits to master rather than 1) it would jump from beta0001 to beta0006?",,,,,,
275892502,1555,Issue,"I just tried, and yes, it will be incremented by how many commits the PR branch contains. I hadn't thought about that. Is this a problem? I saw you squashed my previous PRs, do you do this for PRs that target `master`, too?",,,,,,
275892647,1555,Issue,Yeah we squash PR's normally since it keeps the history cleaner. I think it's ok 👌,,,,,,
276231038,1554,Issue,any idea why this issue - and the other ones - didn't get closed? I thought putting the correct message in the PR description would do the trick. Or do you need to put it in the commit message when you squash the commits into one while merging the PR?,,,,,,
276248124,1554,Issue,What you did should have worked Maybe it's the full stop at the end of the line?!,,,,,,
275798147,1553,Issue,"Hi  many thanks for taking up this feature enhancement!The progress looks good so far!  A couple of comments:If we look at the official [API docs] I can see that the request to ""Add or Update Organization Membership"" actually takes a parameter to indicate the role the user should have (eg Mmber, Admin).  So that means you would create a new Request model object (eg `OrganizationMembershipUpdate`) that has a `Role` property of that enum type.And looking at the response model returned, currently you have this defined as a single `enum` however it is actually a response object that includes `State`, `Role`, `Oragnization` and `User` fields.  So you will actually want your `OrganizationMembership` be a response class that has these fields on it, and rename your enum to something like `OrganizationMembershipStatus`If you add some integration tests it will be easy to test this call against the real github.com - make sure you follow the details in our contributors section about how to configure the integration test settings (and of course, make sure you have setup a test github account and organization so you arent using your real account, if you havent already)Let me know if you want more detailed help or if you are happy to have a crack at addressing these. :+1:",,,,,,

Here's the commit where we removed the code, which previously had an Obsolete message: Originally we had `client.Release` but we wanted to align the Octokit API with how the GitHub documentation organizes it's endpoints. This meant moving it under `Repository`, like this page: Of course, this doesn't address how we keep the documentation in sync for when the API changes. I don't have any good answers on this - but we can currently test Linqpad snippets against the real binaries and catch failures at the CI stage, if that's something we want to leverage more broadly...",,,,,,
271468115,1531,Issue,How would I call that? I'm not familiar with the GitHub API and/or how to read it. Am I anywhere close to the nail?,,,,,,
271546360,1531,Issue,Yep that's it.  Basically it was just relocated from `client.Release` to `client.Repository.Release`It's an interesting point though about how to keep documented code samples up to date.  I guess some sort of system where the linqpad snippets (which we can automatically test) are embedded into documentation...

271284025,1529,Issue,Is this related to something I found when working on a PR here:   ?If you see the 2nd bullet point where I talk about the attempted `ApiError` deserialization never returning a `null` and thus never falling back to the text payload...,,,,,,
272695422,1529,Issue,"Just refreshing my memory with this stuff and yes I agree with your suggestion.  Specifically I think the 2nd suggested fix would be the way to go, since we can ""fix"" it in one place, rather than needing to fix it in every place that currently has `ApiErrorMessageSafe ?? ""default error text""`And this is a different situation to what I commented about above - in that case I found that a compeltely invalid json structure in the error message was still returning a default/empty `ApiError` object because the deserializer creates an object then tries to populate any fields that match the setter properties.  This led to code that was never really getting what it expected, since `ApiError` itself could never be `null`.  Your case is slightly different since it would also happen if there was valid json error payload but the `message` field was empty string or not present.",,,,,,
272711072,1529,Issue,"👍 Got it, makes sense. I'll put together a PR to un-skip this test and fix it via the decision here.",,,,,,
271293359,1528,Issue,/  ready for review at your leisure.,,,,,,
271296108,1528,Issue,"one thing I wanted to check on here. I see a build failure telling me to add an override for `GetObjectData` to the exception. I see that `ApiException` does this.However, `AbuseException` inherits from `ForbiddenException`, and `ForbiddenException` does not have this override, yet does not see this error on build.Should I:* Add overrides to both `ForbiddenException` and `AbuseException` as part of this PR?* Suppress this warning and open an issue to fix later?* Suppress this warning and fuggedaboudit?* Something else I'm not seeing?I noticed on the `ApiException` that it's marked as `[SecurityCritical]` so I didn't want to make any assumptions.",,,,,,
271300164,1528,Issue,"So to me it looks like you only need to override `GetObjectData()` if you have extra properties on the class.  `ForbiddenException` doesn't have any properties of it's own so it doesn't have to do this, but your `AbuseException` class does have a property, so I think that explains why the error occurs on `AbuseException` and not on `ForbiddenException`.So to correctly implement the `[Serializable]` attribute (and satisfy the code analysis CA2240 error), it sounds like you do need to provide a `GetObjectData()` override on `AbuseException`.  And it also needs to be marked as `[SecurityCritical]` due to what was mentioned in #1493 (essentially it needs to match the base class method being overridden)",,,,,,
271300999,1528,Issue,"ahhh, I see. Thanks! This is likely due to the `RetryAfterSeconds` property, which makes sense. Will get that cleaned up ASAP and then it should be good to go.",,,,,,
271301344,1528,Issue,"Also regarding the test that you removed because it was failing due to #1529 im thinking so we dont lose the test maybe add it back in and skip it for now.  That way we have a test that captures the problem and a good way to test a fix later, by unskipping that test?",,,,,,

271478663,1528,Issue,"mind giving the code a second look? Should be much more compact now and the new test file has been re-organized (I left `ConnectionTests` in a similar state to as I found it, due to not wanting to arbitrate the conventions).I inverted some if statements which led to some negatives inside the ifs, but I don't think it compromised on clarity.

271157508,1527,Issue,sounds good. I'll plan to tackle this in the following way: * Create a new Exception Inheriting from ForbiddenException* Modify `Connection.cs` to throw the new exception (with tests)* Add the `Retry-After` as a readonly field within the constructor based on the headers from the `IResponse` that are passed in.,,,,,,
271283196,1527,Issue,"any preferences on what to do if the `Retry-After` header isn't present or can't be parsed? We could default to a number, e.g. 60 seconds, or we could make the field a nullable int. For now, will proceed with idea of a default value of 60 seconds.",,,,,,

262370597,1504,Issue,"Cool...  A couple more thoughts:- We shouldnt change the signature of the `ctor`'s as they are public and it would be a breaking change.  I guess we can still take the enum field in the `ctor` then assign it to the `xxxxText` property like `StatusText = status.ToString()`- I guess the helper function doing the enum parsing needs to handle the transition from snake case to camel case too, like the JsonSerializer does.  Eg the text value might be ""client_interface"" which we need to parse into `xxxx.ClientInterface` so it will need to convert snake_case to CamelCase first before trying to parse the value?- Need to think about how to test we have these changes correct.  We already have some serialization unit tests for response classes but I'd be suggesting that for each response class we touched, we add unit tests where we feed a json string containing a valid response and one containing a valid response EXCEPT the enum value is one that doesnt match the enum, and then assert all fields on the returned objects are as expected- Will there be any performance impact?  Previously the deserializer was caching enum deserializations so we were basically only ""figuring out"" each enum once no matter how many objects of that response type were encountered.  Now we dont have any of that overhead but everytime the enum field is accessed we are parsing the string to an enum.  If this does cause performance impact I guess we could set the enum field's value whenever we set the text value (ie the `ctor` and the `setter` of the text property) rather than everytime we access it.  It may not even affect performance thoughIm not sure if these changes are getting to kludgy though, need some feedback from  if we are heading too far down a rabbit hole.  I guess the alternative was throwing exceptions whenever an API response changed which wasnt great either :)",,,,,,

262618707,1504,Issue,"There is always the trouble of a partner reusing a synthetic value (ie: 'unknown'). **unknown** is probably sufficient, but more descriptive naming may lessen the risk.An additional positive of more descriptive naming is that an external developer seeing the event type will know that this is an artifact of the octokit library as opposed to something odd with the REST api. **octokit_unsupported_type** or simply **octokit_unsupported** might be an alternative.That said, thank you, .

My most recent points for consideration still stand.And a couple of further points:- I tend to agree with the comments about naming the placeholder value something more obvious... such as `OctokitUnsupportedValue` rather than just `Unknown`- Continuing the second guessing over ""Naming things"", Im wondering if `xxxRaw` is better than `xxxText` for the `string` property that will hold the raw actual response.  Thoughts?- Since going down this road will impose the requirement on all future changes to handle enums on response classes in this way I would like us to ""enforce"" this by adding to our convention tests  - find all enums that are used in Response classes and ensure they have this `UnknownApiValue` placeholder value  - find all Response classes that have an enum typed member (eg `Blah`) and ensure they have a `string BlahText` property",,,,,,

Is this a problem?  If it's not a problem, then why do we need to guard any of them?",,,,,,
268788287,1503,Issue,"This is really great stuff  I can't spot anything too serious and everything is locally working for me including builds in VS2015 and cake script, unit tests, integration tests etc.  I guess the next steps are to actually prove things are working (eg a running dotnet core app on on mac/linux/windows using octokit.core library) as well as a traditional full framework dotnet app on windows using the newly built library.  We can also work on our nuget packages (AppVeyor should be spitting them out) to see if they are working etc...  The last piece of the puzzle was source linking in the PDB files but I dont think either of the 2 options mentioned (SourceLink and GitLink) will work for us at this time.  I found another fork/derivative recently that Im going to look at [PdbGit]",,,,,,
268920024,1503,Issue,"Thanks for the review , much appreciated. I pushed some changes according to your comments.You were right for the `HAS_REGEX_COMPILED_OPTIONS`, it was meant for `net45` but I forgot it.I made some changes to the reflection code based on a trick  used, which is to define the `GetTypeInfo` method for platforms that don't have it. This way, you can use `GetTypeInfo` consistently in your code without having to guard for it. A few other extensions methods were created to create missing APIs in `netstandard1.1`  that exist in `net45`, like `GetProperty` or `GetMember`.",,,,,,
271007789,1503,Issue,"regarding making sure everything works, do you want to publish a pre-release package on NuGet and asking people who are keen to try to update and make sure their apps still work? Or were you leaning towards us making sure it looks OK?",,,,,,

It looks to me that we need to hook this into the CAKE pipeline since NuGet packages are created as part of it. A very quick search leads me to think that we can't just execute an .exe from CAKE, we'd need to create some code that wraps that execution. Is this correct?Cheers!",,,,,,
272127966,1503,Issue,"Alright, I took a shot at integrating PdbGit in the CAKE pipeline. It was quickly put together and possibly not very robust, but it works on both my local and AppVeyor.",,,,,,
272294223,1503,Issue,Wow that's awesome! Have you actually tried source debugging the built dll/pdb?,,,,,,
272296621,1503,Issue,"*Edit:*I tried with the symbols NuGet package artifacts of the latest AppVeyor build. I can see VS trying to load a file from GitHub. It doesn't work though as it's trying to get the file from [the octokit.net organisation] repository, which is the first issue. The second thing is what I suppose is the commit SHA it's linking to, and I can't find it in either `octokit.net/octokit#master` not `mderriey/octokit.net#port-to-dotnet-core`.Again, this is all very new to me so maybe I'm making false assumptions.---I haven't :confounded:. The instructions look pretty simple but every time I tried it in the past I was never able to make it work...Sorry about that. Do you think you could give it a go? If not I'll try my luck once again :+1: As an aside, I'm very new to source linking, so please forgive my ignorance. Could you tell me why neither SourceLink nor GitLink would work?",,,,,,
272324934,1503,Issue,"Im also not very across this stuff either by the way.  My basic understanding is that source linking allows stepping into the source of a nuget loaded dll without requiring symbol servers etc.  It somehow embeds the links of the files on github into the PDB file.SourceLink and GitLink both scraped csproj files and so on, so they werent compatible with dotnet core (due to project.json) but then even with the ""new"" csproj for dotnet core now, I suspect they will still need to be changed since the csproj doesnt actually contain all files anymore and just has globs etc.  PdbGit was another one I found which seemed to take a different approach and you pointed at the actual PDB files rather than the source project file, although I have no idea if that means it would work with dotnet core PDB files or not etc...  It's pretty much stuff that needs to be researched... and in the meantime I believe one or both of SourceLink/GitLink are making moves to support dotnet core now that the new project structure is here.In terms of PdbGit it probably makes sense that an AppVeyor build from a PR in this repo wouldnt know to reference files/commits from the contributors fork/branch and is instead trying to hit the official repo... although it's weird that the commit hash doesnt seem to exist anywhere :grining: I guess we can always look at the PdbGit source code or reach out to the author to answer some of these questions.  It also could be possible to pass parameters to PdbGit for the SHA and repository to use (but then Im not sure if AppVeyor even knows those details).It's not really important to build source linked PDB files from pending PR's though anyway... we really just want the ""official"" builds from the octokit repo to have that capability.  What I'd like to do when we cut over to this dotnet core and CAKE stuff, is have every build from master branch publish a pre-release package to nuget.org, and then periodically do the ""official"" releases like we do now.",,,,,,
272333249,1503,Issue,"Alright, after cloning the repo [like AppVeyor does], posh-git shows me that `326116e` commit SHA that [PdbGit uses to link sources]. I don't know where it comes from, though.So what I did is a fresh clone of the repository that lives under my account, built it, created a console application pointing to the newly built assembly with the modified pdb next to it, and gave it a go.It partially works, in the sense that I can F11 into the code from the Octokit assembly, but it's off by a line in the file that I tried. Trying to set a breakpoint on a specific line of code would have VS show a popup saying `The following breakpoint cannot be set [...] The breakpoint failed to bind`.---",,,,,,
272368802,1503,Issue,"Unfortunately this doesn't work. As far as AppVeyor is concerned, the repo comes from `octokit.net/octokit`. I know it's not a big deal but I wanted to see if I could get this working.Now here's a crazy: how about we publish a prerelease package of Octokit targeting `netstandard1.1` and use it in this PR to get the correct repo and commit information since AppVeyor gives us the PR number? I know it's a very small test and won't cover much, though.What are your thoughts?",,,,,,
272692737,1503,Issue,"Yep I think we can publish a prerelease alpha package off this branch (without source linking in the PDB) so we can play around with it further in test projects and get something in the hands of our users so they can kick the tyres too.  If you also want to play with writing a CAKE helper that uses that octokit dotnetcore library to find out the correct URL to pass to PdbGit so source linking of pending PR builds works from the contributors source branch that's cool from a ""nailed it!"" perspective... although not ""necessary"" if you dont want to, since I dont think we would ever publish packages from a pending PR.  I do plan to step up the release frequency this year, including automatic publishing by the CAKE build script of every merged PR to master as a prerelease package to nuget, but I dont think packages from inflight PR's would be a thing wanted or needed.  Still, for ""science"" it could be cool to see if you can get it working 😛",,,,,,

256348860,1496,Issue,"Yes the [API call you highlighted ] is already implemented in octokit as `client.Organization.Team.GetAllRepositories()`And the reason why the first call you mentioned doesnt work anymore is that the github API only returns limited team information on the ""get teams for repo"" call, as you can see in the [api docs here].  I cant be certain but I think this all changed when the organization permissions were revamped [back in September 2015].The interesting thing is that in GitHub Enterprise this change was in 2.4 so Im not sure why you weren't already running into this.  Perhaps it was only when those organization changes [came out of preview] and then whichever subsequent GHE release (2.5 or 2.6) that made it into?Anyway try out the `Team.GetAllRepositories()` and let us know if that works for you?",,,,,,

263998817,1495,Issue,"OK so did you get confirmation that this had changed upstream?  I thought for as long as Ive been using octokit it was like this - Eg since `PullRequests` are also/actually `Issues`, the ""comments"" you see on the discussion area were always obtained from getting them from the `Issue` API, and the ""comments"" on the PullRequest API were always the ""review"" comments... even before   all the changes to make code reviews a native/first class concept.  I just want to clarify with  you said this is how you expect it to work, not necessarily that it used to work like this and has since changed, right?I dont disagree that we could rename the `PullRequest.Comment` API cliient to `PullRequest.ReviewComment` but just trying to quantify whether this was an upstream change or just a legacy/confusing name scenario",,,,,,

Happy for you to send a pull request for any you find to discuss/review further",,,,,,
251004118,1483,Issue,"![]Yeah, I think this is a necessary evil of `await` for library code - while`CloneHttpRequestMessageAsync` has it's own `await` and `ConfigureAwait` usage this doesn't mean callers know about it - it only sees `Task`. I'm concerned that your code using `.Result` - which will block the current thread - doesn't reflect reality. Are you able to provide a small sample WinForms app which uses `async void` or equivalent, so I can see this behaviour for myself?",,,,,,
251007362,1483,Issue,"Okay, now I'm confused. Using `.Result` allows resolving the task for a non-asynchronous application like mine. If I don't call `Result`, the code will simply continue to run without the task necessary terminated.Whether you call `.Wait()` on the task or use `.Result` directly, this will block the current thread until the task has completed. This is different to how `ICriticalNotifyCompletion` (the interface which `.ConfigureAwait(false)` returns) works around scheduling continuations. Nop, I cannot provide any `async void` that will not work, since if I create an async method, the UI will not be blocked.I'm not sure I follow - if you're `await`ing on the result of a task, it will be made available to you when it's ready.

250724527,1480,Issue,"Naming things is always hard 😀 what you've suggested sounds fine Although you probably know me well enough to know that I always have an opinion :grinning: so if discussion is wanted over naming of the request/response model classes, my 2c is that ""Project""  is already a sufficient enough entity to name everything with so I probably would use ""Project"" ""ProjectCard"" ""ProjectColumn"" rather than ""RepositoryProjectXxx"".  For example a pull request, issue etc all belong to a repository but we don't call them ""RepositoryPullRequest"" ""RepositoryIssue"" That's just my thoughts, not saying you have to rename everything (unless you agree with my assertions)",,,,,,
250726161,1480,Issue,Although you probably know me well enough to know that I always have an opinion 😀I know 😄 😸 . But i wasn't sure because there are sometimes classes which be called different. For eg. and on the other side there is `RepositoryIssueRequest.cs`. So i agree with you that `Project`sounds better then `RepositoryProject`. So i think will rename them.,,,,,,

257078499,1480,Issue,Hey  sorry for not getting stuck into this yet!  It's a busy time of year...Not sure if you saw but some changes were recently announced regarding this preview API.  Do you think it just impacts your endpoints and function parameters or does it also mean the actual calls need to live in a different place?[GitHub Developer Blog - Changes to Projects API],,,,,,
257116083,1480,Issue,"Hi , wow, that's a lot of changes. So i have to step through. Please correct me if i'm wrong1. There are 2 new endpoints `List organization projects` and `Create organization projects`2. The responses and the request of this two are same like for public projects. So i think they stay under the same client `RepositoryProjectsClient` and we name them `GetAllForOrganization` and `CreateForOrganization`3. `/repos/:owner/:repo/projects/:number` endpoints are deprecated and will be removed on 10. November. So i think we should wait for 10. November before we add this feature into client. So we can  already remove these endpoints and only use the new  id endpoints `/projects/:id`Or do you think we should add these changes now and remove them after 10. November? Do we have some work with scopes on client side?",,,,,,
257139499,1480,Issue,"Hey , it was a little late yesterday 😴 . I just now realize that they completly reorganized the projects api. So i think like you say they need to live in a different place.1.

But then `SubscribersCount` field was also deprecated/removed in issue #736.  So apparently the ""correct"" way to retrieve this info is using the ""Watchers"" API `WatchedClient.GetAllWatchers()` instead.Although, since the API response still include the `SubscribersCount` field (showing the correct value of 125 for this repo, for example) and the linked blog in #699 mentions they will be supported indefinitely in API v3, perhaps it would be OK to add the field back in again. or  care to comment on these historic issues?  From my perspective, if `SubscribersCount` is still being returned AND contains the correct value, it was possibly premature to remove it and require additional API calls to get that information?Ive created PR #1473 to add `SubscribersCount` field back, as well as a couple of others that were missing (as per #1400)",,,,,,

248498215,1469,Issue,"Hi -work thanks heaps for your contribution!  :grinning: A couple of things for you:### Breaking changes to public interfaces/methodsBeing a public API we do need to be careful about not breaking existing users and the renamed methods in `ApiUrls` class would currently be a ""breaking"" change for people.  Whilst they are just helper methods, given they are `public` we could have users that are using them and as such I believe they would fall under our obligation to not make breaking changes without going through the normal process (see below).It makes sense to rename the existing `ApiUrls.Organizations()` to `ApiUrls.UserOrganizations()` as you've done but technically that means the old name can't be used for the new ""all organizations"" URL since it needs to be obsoleted.  You'll need to use a different name for that one such as `ApiUrls.AllOrganizations()`.### Maintaining naming consistencyWe try to follow a naming convention where `GetAll` gets the given resource, `GetAllForCurrent()` is for the current user, `GetAllForUser()` is for a nominated user etc.  So in this case, `GetAllOrganizations()` should really just be named `GetAll()` since they are in the organizations client already.  I realize you went with this option because the other methods were already just called `GetAll` but infact they SHOULD have been called `GetAllForUser(string login)` all this time... So it would be cool if you could rename `GetAll(string user) => GetAllForUser(string login)` as part of this change, and implement `GetAll()` as your new method rather than calling it `GetAllOrganizations()`.  Any renames would be done following the ""normal process"" outlined below.#### Process for breaking changes:Create the new method/implementation/classes and mark any old ones as We wait at least 2 releases before removing the obsolete items from the code base.  This gives users some notice (in the form of compiler warnings) before things change on them :+1: Let me know if you need any help with this and thanks for stepping up to correct this missing functionality!",,,,,,
248499171,1469,Issue,"Another thing I just realized is that the API docs mentions this ""List organizations"" API method is not paginated like normal methods (pagesize, count etc), and instead just uses the `since` parameter.  So you wont be able to take `ApiOptions` in your method signature, instead you'll need a custom request class with the `Since` parameter.  You can have a look at the `Repositories.GetAllPublic(PublicRepositoryRequest request)` method for some ideas on how to tackle that",,,,,,
249599422,1469,Issue,Hi  Thanks for your time and for the review. I did the modification you have requested.,,,,,,
251191502,1469,Issue,Hi  I have obsoleted the old `ApiUrls.Organizations()` and created the integration tests like you requested.If anything else let me know.Thanks,,,,,,
251260685,1469,Issue,"Thanks -work sorry I hadnt had a chance over the weekend to look at this.  I will try and do it tonight.  Have you actually run the integration tests?  I notice they are flagged as GitHubEnterprise (because they create organizations to then run the tests against, and create organizations is not avaialble on github.com only github enterprise).  For something like a GET call, we could potentially run the test against github.com but I guess that becomes hard since we dont know what organization ID to use as the `since` parameter (and as time marches on, any ID used in the test will start to become further and further back in time, leading to the test retrieving larger amounts of orgs until it eventually times out!).  So probably leaving the tests as `GitHubEnterprise` tests is fine, but we do just need to make sure they actually run succesfully of course :grinning:  I wll pull this down and run the tests etc and get back to you",,,,,,

246533001,1464,Issue,"Here is how I see this:- **When deciding on guidelines, consistency trumps virtually everything else**. Developers don't just use one component of .NET, they use a ton of .NET components. So even if an entire component is exclusively async, staying consistent with other components that offer both async and sync APIs helps. It also helps in code reviews because calling a method that is suffixed with `Async` but is not awaited is almost always a bug.- **We do not perform breaking changes**. Sometimes, guidelines come to be after a given API has shipped. That's unfortunate, which is why we have a special support group at Microsoft where we can cry, pet each other's back and drink hoppy beverages to deal with it. But that's how the cookie crumbles.So consistency is important, but breaking people's code just because it doesn't meet certain guidelines is silly and directly interferes with the reason we have guidelines in the first place: making our customers successful. Of course, you _could_ offer additional overloads that are properly named but then your component uses both naming conventions and code base will most likely ending up with calling a mixture. In my opinion, that's even worse because now the async suffix means nothing in Octokit.So I'd be in favor of closing as won't fix./cc",,,,,,
246533948,1464,Issue,"As I recall, the reason .NET has `Async` suffixes all over the place is because the original API was not async, and to maintain compatibility, instead of making the API async-first (as MS wanted), they instead added the `Async` suffix. MS decided not to break the API and every user out there even though an async-first API was their preferred choice.The irony of creating new APIs outside of the original framework (and octokit is not a part of the .NET class libraries, it is an independent entity that has its own identity and API design decisions) and making them sync-first with `Async` suffixes for the async behaviour is, well, ironic?",,,,,,

246541226,1464,Issue,"The main reason I suggested this was that when starting with the API this completely throw me off. I knew what I wanted had to be async, but I couldn't find any async methods. It's also really inconvenient not instantly knowing you need to put await in front of some code, but have to go look at the signature.As  said this is why coding guidelines are important and when working with multiple libraries it can really throw off a developer. I don't think the reasons you present are correct (it sounds more like rumors and doesn't really fit with other things that were in .NET before Tasks - take a look at what they did to WebClient for instance). It's just as much about readability, eases code-reviews etc. Just because we have async/await doesn't mean multithreading problems gets any easier (besides the less code needed), and it's nice when the code explicitly calls out that there's context switching, it's non-blocking, likely long-running etc.Regarding 's comment: Breaks literally every piece of software written using Octokit, for literally zero tangible benefits to users of the libraryNo. Consistency, predictability and readability of an API is not zero benefit. Secondly as I mentioned, when you provide the new overloads, you [mark the old ones obsolete], and [hide them from intellisense]. That means you won't see the old overloads clouding up intellisense, they'll still work and users gets warnings telling them to move to the new ones.

246582030,1464,Issue,"Mark every method that return Task as obsolete it means mark Octokit.NET as obsolete (Observable methods are just wrappers). And I think that this is unacceptable for now. Time for such code convention decision is gone for Octokit.  Consistency, predictability and readability of an API is not zero benefit. I definitely agree with that, but not in case of Octokit and Async suffix. Octokit is fully asynchronous library, each method in each client is async. This .NET Framework 4.5 library and it doesn't have any legacy API that uses obsolete asynchronous programming patterns (such as [APM] or [EAP]). So, I think that in case of Octokit Async suffix not so valuable and can be omitted. The main reason I suggested this was that when starting with the API this completely throw me off. I knew what I wanted had to be async, but I couldn't find any async methods. Maybe, it will be nice add remark about lack of Async suffix in README.md with accent on the fact that Octokit is fully async?",,,,,,

247327677,1445,Issue,"I agree with . To add to that, these overloads where added in [0.21] which was only the release before last.",,,,,,
247339735,1445,Issue,"It's up to you peeps. As far as the runtime is concerned, int->long is a breaking change at the ABI level, i.e., it'll throw methodnotfoundexception if you get the long version and you compiled against the int version. Since you don't sign the assembly, the runtime is free to provide whatever is already loaded in the domain, which might or might not be the actual specific version that is ABI compatible with what you built against.But, since this is a < 0.x library and you don't sign it, there's no stringent compatibility requirement and it's going to blow up in people's faces anyway in shared appdomain scenarios, so ¯_(ツ)_/¯",,,,,,
247342302,1445,Issue,"Given its delivered via nuget there wouldn't be any supported way to update to the new version WITHOUT also compiling against it though right? Obviously  can have the final say but based on these points I think we should not worry about it - not a breaking change for almost all use cases - amount of work/churn to obsolete int methods is large - int methods were only recently added anyway, further reducing the target audience that could be affected",,,,,,
247400664,1445,Issue,"Given its delivered via nuget there wouldn't be any supported way to update to the new version WITHOUT also compiling against it though right?Weeeeell actually (:trollface:), bla bla bla signing bla versioning bla runtime loader bla plugin model bla horrible explosion. There's a whole signing/versioning/plugin model discussion on that one and it's not relevant for this case 😄 When updating the nuget package and compiling against the new version, things should not break at all at compile time because implicit casts for wider numeric types are a thing. There might be silly people out there invoking octokit via reflection, that'll break them (but they probably deserve it? ¯_(ツ)_/¯)",,,,,,
247497092,1445,Issue,Excellent points . Let's do this.,,,,,,
239776763,1444,Issue,Rather than only including the moving of methods to the branches API it would be good to get the top level branch protection stuff in this release.  It's ready to merge apart from :lipstick: #1407,,,,,,
239777065,1444,Issue,so that's #1441 and #1443?,,,,,,
239777985,1444,Issue,"No, just #1441 .  That's enough to manage branch protections with the new API structure.  #1443 isnt ready yet, and is also just gravy (allows more granular editing of portions of branch protection, but they al lcan be set by the top level methods in #1441 anyway).So yeah id like #1441 in this release if possible :)  Just addressing your comments now",,,,,,
239778409,1444,Issue,:thumbsup:,,,,,,
242071175,1444,Issue,Id also like to include #1450 in this release since its a trivial change but a much awaited feature,,,,,,
243325945,1444,Issue,let me know if there's any other obsoletions I've missed here,,,,,,
243401041,1444,Issue,"I corrected one typo but I've realised I missed obsoleting some of the stuff on the observable interface... also now that the new branch protection methods are implemented we can actual direct users to the alternative/replacement methods rather than just saying those old ones ""will cease to work"".  Ill push a PR to fix up the wording etc now - #1452In terms of the branch protection stuff I dont know if its worth calling it out in the release notes somehow or not, but basically branch protection works fairly differently now (all due to the upstream changes made in github api).Previously:- `Branch` objects inclued a `Protection` field which contained all the branch protection settings, and you could enable/disable branch protection using the `client.Repository.EditBranch()` method (also now moved to `client.Repository.Branch.Edit()`).  Now:- `Branch` objects have a `bool Protected` property, and an additional endpoint is required (`client.Repository.Branch.GetBranchProtection()` to get the actual protection settings (but it throws a 404 exception if protection is not actually enabled so you have to check that `Branch.Protected` flag first).  You edit protection settings using `client.Repository.Branch.UpdateBranchProtection()` and you disable protection using `client.Repository.Branch.DeleteBranchProtection()`Im not sure how to summarize the nicely in the release notes though!",,,,,,
243981817,1444,Issue,Im not sure how to summarize the nicely in the release notes though!I'll give it a shot - thanks for the initial start!,,,,,,
244004348,1444,Issue,This is shipped:- -,,,,,,
239753256,1443,Issue,In the delete method for the `required status checks contexts` the API says it returns an [array]. This is ok if you delete one context. But if you delete more then one context it returns an empty array.  can you confirm this?,,,,,,
239778612,1443,Issue,These naming convention tests fails because i have named methods for example  `GetProtectedBranchUserRestrictions`. Should we rename to `GetAllProtectedUserRestrictions`?,,,,,,
239787442,1443,Issue,"These naming convention tests fails because i have named methods for example GetProtectedBranchUserRestrictions. Should we rename to GetAllProtectedUserRestrictions?I guess you could.  I wonder whether that method ""actually"" supports pagination though.  that convention test just thinks that any method that returns a `List<>` and starts with `Get...()` supports pagination.  Maybe if you make a version that takes `ApiOptions` then see if it actually does paginate when you send up a page size of 1?  Then based on whether it supports pagination or not, we can figure out whether to rename the method so it complies, or whether to modify the convention test to not include these methods",,,,,,
239787636,1443,Issue,But if you delete more then one context it returns an empty array.As long as we correctly deserialized the empty array I think this would be fine/expected.  Does it not work currently or were you just clarifying?,,,,,,
239788305,1443,Issue,It's just for clarifiying.,,,,,,
240960654,1443,Issue,"So, i have tested all the api endpoints and no one support pagination. So  we have to exclude all the new methods from the convention test. Is there any flag we can set to exclude these methods? In the meantime i start to write the unit tests for the new methods.",,,,,,
241162827,1443,Issue,"So in the `GetClientInterfaces()` method in `PaginationTests.cs` I can see it does exclude the `IStatisticsClient` from that list, but in your case you probably dont want to exclude the whole `IRepositoryBranches` client since some methods DO paginate.  So I guess that means you'd have to exclude the actual methods in the test itself, ie where it calls `clientInterface.GetMethodsOrdered()` you could add a where clause to exclude the known methods (or use a new attribute eg `[ExcludeFromPaginationConventionTest]` or whatever)",,,,,,
241731085,1443,Issue,Hi . In my last commits i have created an attribute `ExcludeFromTest` to filter the new methods. I have exclude these methods in `PaginationTests` and in `SyncObservableClients`. Can you also have look of the return types for the observable methods. Because they don't support pagination they have to be for example `IObservable`. Is that correct?,,,,,,
241781172,1443,Issue,ExcludeFromPaginationTestAttribute is better but i use this Attribute also to exclude from `SyncObservableClients`. Should i create two attributes?,,,,,,
241940713,1443,Issue,"As far as I know even if the api doesnt support pagination, you should still have the observable implementation return an `IObservable`Therefore all client methods should comply with the `SyncObservableClients` convention test and there is no need to skip it.~~Im pretty sure even the methods that DO paginate actually grab ALL pages from the non reactive client first, as they call `.ToList().ToObservable()` on them (the `ToList()` forcing the entire enumerable to be retrieved upfront).  So you should be able to do the same thing on these calls.~~Oops... i was wrong on that part but anyway I think in your case you should still be able to force the `List` by calling `client.GetBlah().ToObservable().SelectMany(x => x);` which if you look through the code base there are a few instances of this already (eg in MiscellaneousClient, UserEmailsClient, UserGpgKeysClient, UserKeysClient)",,,,,,
241940910,1443,Issue,"And regarding the attribute, I agree that specific named `[ExcludeFromPaginationConventionTest]` attribute is preferable to a generic `[ExcludeFromTest]` attribute since the latter impies it's excluded from all tests which isnt the case.  Plus gtiven the above comments there is no need to exclude these things from more than 1 test at the moment anyway, so go with `[ExcludeFromPaginationConventionTest]`",,,,,,
242343639,1443,Issue,"Hi , can you please give a feedback. I think this PR is ready.",,,,,,
243086665,1443,Issue,Sorry for the shifting goal posts   but what I did in #1441 with the user and team push restrictions was introduced specific classes rather than just using `List` so I think we need to use those classes in these changes too,,,,,,
243090347,1443,Issue,"That make sense. So you mean instead of ~~returning `Task teams)` we should do this `public Task SetProtectedBranchTeamRestrictions(string owner, string name, string branch, BranchProtectionTeamCollection teams)`",,,,,,
243092146,1443,Issue,No it's not in the return types it's in the request types,,,,,,
243092852,1443,Issue,I have correct my commit.,,,,,,
243093295,1443,Issue,"I have correct my comment.ah cool, sorry :grinning:  Yes :+1: that's what I meant - change the team/user inputs that are `IReadOnlyList` to `BranchProtectionTeamCollection` or `BranchProtectionUserCollection` instead",,,,,,
243102682,1443,Issue,What about `IReadOnlyList` or we don't need this because there is no difference between them.,,,,,,
243109845,1443,Issue,"The specific classes came about because I had a request that needed to take users and/or teams so without them having different types we couldn't provide nice constructor options Contexts is fine to leave as strings, IMO",,,,,,

244501047,1443,Issue,"OK Ive had a go through this so here is some review comments:I realise youve named things exactly as I mapped out in the issue, but unfortunately I seem to have been inconsistent there in that I called some methods that REPLACE settings as `UpdateBlah` and others as `SetBlah`.   is more in line with terminology used in the rest of the code base, so Im thinking we should rename => `UpdateProtectedBranchTeamRestrictions`  => `UpdateProtectedBranchUserRestrictions`",,,,,,
244671887,1443,Issue,", thanks for your review!!",,,,,,
244934453,1443,Issue,"Hey  great job, a few more comments marked up regarding some `team2` test contexts still not being disposed, and also some xml comments.A couple of other things I picked up:- There are many cases of spurious `/>` at the end of the summary field in xml comment text like this:- There seems to be alot of the `[ExcludeFromPaginationTest]` attributes on methods when I thought only some of the `Getxxxx` methods would need that.  It's currently on Add Delete and Update methods tooAnd now for something a bit more general- As you know the Team/User restrictions only apply to organization owned repos.  So there is actually no need to have `xxxxForOrgRepo` tests for the status check/contexts endpoint tests.  Since there is no difference to running these for an organization vs personal repo.  In the case of the main top level methods I implemented, I did need to test the `UpdateBranchProtection()` method for both personal repos (status checks only) and organization repos (setting status checks AND push restrictions), which is why I had to have tests covering both types.  So I say :fire: the `xxxxForOrgRepo` tests you've got for the status check/context endpoints since we dont want to maintain these tests if they arent actually needed  - On that note, it would be good to include in the xml comments field a mention on the restriction related endpoints ""(applies only to Organization owned repositories)"" like I did on the `ctor` parameters of the `BranchProtectionSettingsUpdate` class, just so that users are informed not to use those methods on personal repos",,,,,,

In the 108 commits in your comparison, there are 5 commits with `Author == null` (and `Committer == null` when it was the same as author) and all 5 of them are from 3 unique contributors.  Also there are no other commits from these contributors in this comparison range that DO provide Author/Committer details.  In other words, ALL commits from these 3 authors present with this problem.I've confirmed that the actual json response has this field as `null` (ie there is nothing happening inside octokit deserializer, this is coming from the github api itself)You can also see this fact if you look at the commits themselves:, , , , The author is NOT a normal hyperlink to a github user profile, instead it is just the ""display name"" of the author, according to the git commit data:Same in the [commit list] of the repo, we only see the git author name and not the github author's hyperlinked profileIn terms of the GitHub API object model, the items returned in the comparison results are what we call `GithubCommits` that have ""github"" info on them - things like organization/owner, and full ""user"" objects for Author and Commiter (in these cases this info is null).  Then there is also a `Commit` object that is more the pure ""git"" info, which include author/commiter details from an underlying git point of view (so you get the author's Name and Email, but not any github specific info like login)... just like any git client would show.  So if your intention is to generate a list of people who contributed commits, potentially you could go with `commit.Commit.Author.Name` rather than the github login, or possibly the github author.login is null, fallback to using the git author name instead.Now you've raised this here I realise I actually ran into this just the other day on our GitHub Enterprise instance where when I retrieved commits from a pull request not all `Author` fields were populated.  I didn't dig into it too much and just ended up using `Commit.Author.Name` instead... but I think it's likely to be the same thing.Maybe privacy settings on those users or email verification status?

This seems strange as there doesn't appear to be any  solid platform specific reasons for doing this apart from `[Serializable]` jankyness with exceptions. All of these platforms could be 🔥 and converted into a single project that targets netstandard v1.x after converting to the reflection API that was introduced back in the portable class library days - 's PR has initial WIP conversion of the reflection API. From there you can lift the Akavache build/release pipleine; see  AND get rid of TravisCI 🎉  as you no longer need to generate a mono assembly.Another thing that needs discussing is the migration to a newer version of `System.Reactive` that supports netstandard and in doing so might warrant bumping the major depending on how you interpret semver as if I remember right there was some strong naming changes + major version of the dependency was changed:",,,,,,

231496322,1417,Issue,"someone mentioned something on gitter chat that there may have been some changes to Api rate limits from memory.Have you tried passing an `ApiOptions` to the `GetAll` call and specifying a high records per page size to override whatever the default is?  That way if the default was changed to something lower, but it still allows you to request more per page, you might be OK.In general I was bumping up against some of the same types of issues, where as repositories grow older/larger, our query performance (mainly around generating release notes between any 2 arbitrary points) started to suffer.  I was able to make some efficiency improvements with some of my queries (eg instead of loading all PR's for the repo I used the issue search API to find issues of type PR that are merged between the commit timestamps of the from/to commits I wanted release notes for) and then load those ones with individual  `Get` calls but in parallel... this scales much better in a repo with growing numbers of PRs.So in your particular use case, what is the outcome you are trying to achieve?  There may be ways we can suggest to make your code more scalable as repositories grow larger, rather than always retrieving every single issue event since the beginning of time.  Eg another thing I do for my release notes I need to know the merge commit of the PR's, which you can only find from the ""merge"" event.  Originally I used to get all issue event for the whole repo, but this grew too slow (i didnt run into your issue, just really lengthy query times) so with the above optimisations I now only run this query for the singular issues (PRs) i know i am interested in and by using Tasks to run things in parallel, achieved a pretty scalable query that is only affected by the number of PRs in a release, rather than the size of the repoOr if you are using the issue events to know ""what is happening"" in the repo, then you could instead configure webhooks to hit your service so you get told of each event as it happens, and can process them in the singular context rather than ""all events for the whole repo""Here's a gist showing the approach I mentioned - using parallel tasks to load a smaller set of individual `Get` calls, rather than using GetAll calls.",,,,,,

Not exactly efficient. Our repo is still small enough to make this possible. I was looking at better ways to get the work done before the issue I mention above showed up on Friday.What would be ideal would be to ask only for the comments or events that take place since a certain timestamp (the last hour of comments, for example). It'd be useful to have a similar RepositoryRequest for comments and events as we do for issues.As you point out, some of this could also be done using RepositoryIssueRequest {Since = ...} and just getting events or comments for those issues.

I actually re-organised it so the `GetSuccessfulResponse` and `CopyRequest` functions were last in the class, which then made the diff line up much nicer and revealed only a few lines of difference.  This let me spot a few places where you are not doing exactly what the old code did which I've highlighted in the review comments.  I fixed these locally, plus fixed up a few async/await type issues and renamed `GetSuccessfulResponse` to `SendAsync` and everything is working :gem: for me now with the problem I was facing.

231891224,1411,Issue,have you had a chance to look at those failing tests?,,,,,,
231980952,1411,Issue,Not really. Maybe in the next few days. What i have seen is that we have to completely rewright tests for redirects. Yet they are in `RedirectHandlerTests` but i think we should move them to `HttpClientAdapterTests` because redirecting is now handled directly in there. What do you think?,,,,,,
232133806,1411,Issue,I'll look at those failing tests and see if I can help,,,,,,
232799185,1411,Issue,Hi . I have sit down and think about these failing redirect tests. Here is an approach in which i have move one test into `HttpClientAdapterTests`. Because redirecting is handled by this class. But to translate tests i have to create a new property `RequestMessage` for class `Response` to get access to the `RequestMessage`. What do you think? So this is really a first approach!!,,,,,,
232895338,1411,Issue,I have try to copy these other tests and have find that is not possible to copy them 1 to 1.

Because you anyway translate them into `HttpRequestMessage` like [here],,,,,,
233123590,1411,Issue,"Yeah I dont think we want to add these properties to `IResponse` just so we can ""test"" what request was used.I had a go at re-jigging the tests with the new redirect handling like you've got in this PR.  I found that inside the redirect method, I had to pre-save off the original request's `content` so it could be later added to the request for the redirected Url, as by that stage a `Object has been disposed` exception was thrown when trying to access the original request's content directly.  With this change, and some modifications to the test/mocks I was able to get all the tests passing, except for the `Assert` that tries to verify that same field (`response.RequestMessage.Content`).

230148929,1410,Issue,"Nice work  !  :grinning:  I've made a few comments on various diffs, and also have some overall comments:### API Calls that return no payloadWith the calls that dont return a payload, you'll note the API docs do actually indicate that a ""success"" is a Http 204 (NoContent).  So that means we can actually implement these calls (`Accept`, `Decline`, `Delete`) return a `Task` and then you can actually get the `HttpStatusCode` and return `true` or `false` accordingly.  There are several examples of this in the code base already, one such example is `TeamsClient.RemoveMembership()` if you want to take a look at how it's done### XmlDoc commentsThere are some cases where the XmlDoc comments are not consistent or mention incorrect return types.  I realise some of this is because the comment you may have copied was, itself, incorrect, but we should aim to have correct comments at leats for new work we are adding.  So instead of `IReadOnlyPagedCollection` you should be saying `IReadonlyList` or whatever the actual return type is.

227579046,1403,Issue,"Yeah I ran into this myself yesterday.  Unfortunately looking at the [API docs example] shows that the GitHub API really only returns a couple of Url's (Html, Diff, Patch) for the Pull Request, and not the entire object which would indeed be handy.In my case I ended up using the Search Issue API to get a list of PRs for a specific repo that were merged in a specific date range, THEN i fired off concurrent async calls to load those subset of PR's individually.  This still turned out to be much faster than loading all PRs for the repo with the single `PullRequest.GetAllForRepository()` call (as under the covers, that pages through multiple results).  Also the GetAll call will get slower as the repository grows, whereas the search + parallel PR load is a bit more constrained since the commit (date) ranges (in our case at least) are for only a handful of 2 week iterations rather than the entire repository so it doesnt get that much worse on larger repositories, and then the actual number of PRs we have to load are a much smaller number and again, not going to be AS impacted by growing repository.  Plus running them in parallel helps with speeding them up :grinning: I also get the commits of each PR, the comments of each PR and the merge commit of each PR.  These all require separate calls as well, but doing it in parallel takes the edge off.

227568567,1402,Issue,"It's weird though as this should have worked I thought...  Surely this isn't the first time we have an enum with an overriden value on a request message? Maybe it's `[Parameter(Key=)]` that is required, rather than `[Parameter(Value=)]`It would be good to make that integration test loop through all enum values and ""create reaction"" for each one of them, that would have picked this up in the beginning. I thought we already did that, or at least made the integration test use the enum value that did have the custom override value, but perhaps I'm thinking of the ""Get reaction"" payload and not the create reaction one",,,,,,
227652721,1402,Issue,"I have tested all variations `[Parameter(Key = ""+1"")]`. But if you step trough the serialization process and thenso maybe this is really the first time this happens or i'm wrong :confused:",,,,,,
227663863,1402,Issue,There are also problems when converting back to enum. In `SimpleJsonSerializer.cs` `-1` becomes `1`because of And `+1` is converted to `Minus1` :weary:,,,,,,
227664590,1402,Issue,Maybe we should use hardcoded strings for `ReactionType`?,,,,,,
227690960,1402,Issue,"so maybe this is really the first time this happens or i'm wrong :confused:So there are a fair few other occurences of `Enum`'s on request classes that have `[Parameter(Value = ""xxx"")]` attribute.  Did you want to test these through the serializer to see if they also have the problem?Here's a couple but there are more than these[`MilestoneSort.DueDate`][`SortDirection.Ascending`][`SortDirection.Descending`][`DeployTask.DeployMigrations`][`PullRequestSort.LongRunning`]",,,,,,
227696561,1402,Issue,Here is maybe another solution. For example if you have `+1`  how `Enum.Parse` should parse it to theright value?,,,,,,
227710454,1402,Issue,In think i know where the issue comes from. All the enums with parameters are used Requests which inherits from `Requestparameter`. For example MilestoneRequestIn the Apiconnection call you see `request.ToParametersDictionary()` which internally use reflections to get the parameter attributeIn `ReactionsClient` we pass `reactions` as a normal parameterwhich is serialized bySo the solution for this first problem is to inherit `NewReactiion` from `RequestParameters` and change the Api call for all reaction clients. I have tested this and it works as expected.The second problem is if you get a payload which is serialzed. This only happens at one place.So here i think the only solution is from my last commitSo if you dont't do this and you have a parameter like `+1` you never know if `Enum.Parse` parse it to right enum value.Please correct me if i'm wrong,,,,,,
227923734,1402,Issue,"Although the `ParametersDictionary` approach does fix things, I guess my thoughts are that since a change is needed in `SimpleJsonSerializer` on the `Deserialize` side anyway, we may as well also fix it in the `Serialize` side.  But I don't think it's necessary to write that logic yourself, as there is a `.ToParameter()` extension method in `EnumExtensionMethods` that already handles retrieving the custom parameter if present, otherwise uses lowercase string.  So something like this works, and then we dont need `NewReaction` to inherit `RequestParameters`:",,,,,,
227974776,1402,Issue,`p.ToParameter()` works perfectly :tada:,,,,,,

317716575,1400,Issue,"no progress per se, this wasn't a list of things to implement as many of them aren't desired/required (due to being API url fields or previously deprecated fields etc). It's great you've found one that should be added!  would you consider sending a PR to include it? Thanks",,,,,,
317719585,1400,Issue,"Sure, I can do that at some point this week. Also, I was wondering why, when accessing the Events API, the ""deleted"" field is not included in PushEvent payloads. I'm not talking about Octokit in particular, I mean the actual Events API payload, which I assumed would return the same payload as the event delivered through i.e. a web hook?",,,,,,
317722395,1400,Issue,I'm not sure what the actual reason is for that upstream API behaviour/design but I do see multiple references in the API docs saying that the push event is specifically different payload between the webhook and the events API I guess that confirms its expected behaviour but if you wanted your know WHY you could perhaps try contacting github support and asking?,,,,,,
317729836,1400,Issue,"Okay, thanks a lot, I'll see what I can find.",,,,,,
337923824,1400,Issue,"We were looking at using the `distinct` field on commits specifically (to cut down on processing). There's a bit of weirdness there in that it's on the webhook commit response, but not on the GET /commit response, and as best I can tell OctoKit uses the same model for both. Would that be a nullable bool (seems easier to add from a 'I could make a PR for this' standpoint)? Or would it need to be split out into two models, one for commits from the API & one for commits from a webhook payload?",,,,,,
338044877,1400,Issue,"How different are the response payloads?  Would be great if you could post an example commit json response from both cases so we can see how many fields aren't returned. You're right in that generally we use the same model for the same thing (eg a `PullRequest`) eventhough some API responses (eg a `GetAll` type request) don't include all of the fields that are returned from a single object `Get` request.It sounds reasonable to make this field nullable (and perhaps any others that are in the same boat) rather than splitting out a new object model, unless there are heaps of discrepancies",,,,,,
338402413,1400,Issue,"I compared what I get from a saved webhook (`push` event vs from the api) and added the results/diff in [a gist].Key points:- webhook uses `Id`, commit uses `Sha`- webhook has lists of files affected, api does not (and requires generating a diff)- webhook his a `distinct` field, commit doesn't (which makes sense given `distinct` is only valid at that point in time)- api has info about the tree/parents of the commit, and the webhook doesn't(It turns out that I had actually been using a reimplemented model locally which was how I've been parsing pushes in the first place).I think the worst difference is that it uses different property names to refer to the same thing - like `id` vs `sha`.",,,,,,

226414650,1365,Issue,"The builds are now successful :) I have also added integration tests for the newly added properties, except for the `AutoInactive` property which isn't returned by the API.",,,,,,
226741352,1365,Issue,"except for the AutoInactive property which isn't returned by the API.Just to clarify this statement - are you saying this is an issue, or just meaning that it isnt meant to be returned (since it sounds like it''s more a field on the update request, not on an actual deployment or DeploymentStatus itself?)",,,,,,
226741665,1365,Issue,"As far as I can tell, it makes sense to not return that field as it appears to be intended for use only when creating/updating.",,,,,,
226744304,1365,Issue,"Yep agreed, just wanted to clarify you meant that too :)Ive done a final review and also pulled your branch and run the integration tests etc... This is :gem: and ready to go... congratulations on your first octokit contribution!",,,,,,
226744381,1365,Issue,![LGTM],,,,,,
226750731,1365,Issue,Great! Thanks for the help.![Hurray],,,,,,
225737700,1364,Issue,"it'd be nice to add an integration test to [`MilestonesClientTests`] to verify these new properties are deserialized correctly, but aside from that this is looking good!",,,,,,
225739140,1364,Issue,"Thanks for feedback.  I was thinking I should have added tests based on the contribution notes, but didn't know exactly where being new to this repository.  I will review what you mentioned and try to add soon.",,,,,,
225739407,1364,Issue,"lots of the existing tests are written in the ""arrange-act-assert"" pattern, so feel free to steal from them if you're looking for guidance...",,,,,,
225757745,1364,Issue,"I added a test using [BlobClientTests] as example.  Did not verify Creator property, but left a TODO comment.  If you know of a similar test to verify User, let me know and I can update.",,,,,,
225782675,1364,Issue,"so what you've got there is actually a unit test, that is providing a hardcoded json framgent and testing the deserialisation logic only.  This is great, but what  was referring to was adding an integration test (a test that actually runs against github.com) to [the MilestoneClientTests ].  There is already a test there [CanRetrieveOneMilestone] that you could just add some more asserts to, to prove that your new fields are being returned correctly.eg:In relation to your unit test, to check the value of the creator property you would just do something like `Assert.Equal(""shiftkey"", response.Body.Creator.Login);` and so on",,,,,,
225783907,1364,Issue,"As general comments on this change, I'm :+1: for including useful fields like `HtmlUrl` `UpdatedAt` and even `Id` for a milestone (and various other objects/models)... but I'm not sure about things like `LabelsUrl`.  Simply because those fields are API hypermedia links (eg in this case, the API url to get the labels for this milestone).  Since octokit already provides that information via interfaecs and clients (eg the `IssuesLabelsClient.GetAllForMilestone()` call), Im not sure we need to include this field on the `Milestone` object itself.  Or more to the point, if we do include `LabelsUrl` then we should include all the other `xxxUrl` fields (like events, starred, followers, following, gists, etc).   might have an opinion on this, but my 2c would be to remove `LabelsUrl` from this change...",,,,,,
226033093,1364,Issue,"After reviewing/learning more about the API structure, I think I agree with  on removing LabelsUrl.  It is nice to have the property included, but logic is already in place for IssuesLabelsClient.  I will remove and commit soon.  I originally added similar to others since it was returned in the JSON.",,,,,,
226315791,1364,Issue,"Ive just commented on how to tet the `Creator` property in your tests.Other than that, you just need to update latest master into your branch and we should be good!",,,,,,
226371846,1364,Issue,"well, i've completely screw this up.  your suggestions worked on the user for test.  something went weird when merging and last file changes are not showing up.  many reverts/tries on my branch trying to understand more about VS/Git.  any thoughts on steps to address... it is clear one of my first few times on this :frowning:",,,,,,
226453122,1364,Issue,"So looking at your fork of the repo, it seems you merged your change into the master branch in YOUR fork, and wherever you sent this PR from doesnt actually exist anymore (did you delete your fork and re-fork it or something?  Or just delete the branch it used to be on perhaps?).  Anyway, I think you're going to need to close this PR and recreate it, once youve moved your work to a suitable branch.  At least the work you did is not lost though!  :grinning: Im not sure how much you've already read or not, so dont be offended if Im telling you something you already know, but as a contributor you have a fork of this repo under your own user space (this is referred to as `origin` and then you have this main repository (referred to as `upstream`).  Your local clone on your system will already have an `origin` remote pointing at your fork, and you should add an `upstream` remote pointing here (if you haven't already).You should never make any changes in your master branch, instead you need to [Sync your fork with upstream] to keep your master inline with master here.  To do any work, you cut a branch from latest master, make your changes on that branch.  Always keep that branch up to date with master here (eg if we merge another PR before yours, you should pull master into your pending branch and your PR will update accordingly).  Eventually you send a PR from your fork/branch to the master branch here.  **Only when that PR is merged** should you then sync your master with upstream master (ie you should never push your changes into master on your side yourself, your master should only ever be synched with `upstream/master`Im not sure about Visual Studio git GUI specifically, it may make it possible for you to just deal with `upstream/master` directly, and not have to really worry about `origin/master` much at all.  When teaching people git I tend to encourage consistent initial use of the basic command line commands, to gain the underlying understanding of what is actually happening.  Then we move to GUIs - a religious and contentious space :)  My personal preference is SourceTree but there are many options - GitHub Desktop, Git Extensions, and even VS2015 as you've mentioned (just make sure you're on the very latest Update and also add the GitHub Extension for some nice sugar when dealing with GitHub).Anyway, what we need to do to fix you up is:- Add your upstream remote if you dont already have it- Move your changes to a branch and push it to your fork- Reset your `origin/master` to `upstream/master` and force push it to your fork- Ensure your branch is up to date with `upstream/master`- And then of course raise a new PR for this milestone workThen you should be :gem:Off the top of my head, these would be the commands to do this, forgive any typos/syntax errors :grinning:- Add your upstream remote if you dont already have it- Move your changes to a branch and push it to your fork- Reset your `origin/master` to `upstream/master`- Ensure your branch is up to date with `upstream/master`Then you can raise the new PRHope that helps?",,,,,,

224426455,1347,Issue,"Yep that's on the right track... although what if the test user's organisation has no teams created?Similar to the `RepositoryContext` There is also an (incorrectly named!) `EnterpriseTeamContext` helper that can create a team on the fly and then destroy it when it goes out of scope.  Using this would make the test more reliable and not require any specially configured test organisation.  Another thing that I like to do in integration tests is not only assert the returned object from that update call, but actually make a ""Get"" call (in this case, something like `client.Team.GetAllRepositories()` and check the returned repository in there also indicates the permission level you requested was infact correctly applied.As an aside, while you're at it you could rename that `EnterpriseTeamContext` class and helper method to `TeamContext` rather than `EnterpriseTeamContext` since they are not actually GitHub Enterprise specific...

My vote is `client.Issue`, purely because of how the [API ]is set up and I'm assuming that's the first place users would look.Very curious to see everyone else's thoughts though, my second vote was `Assignees`",,,,,,
223633671,1339,Issue,Ok. Then I place the method under Issue. Is there something more to do?,,,,,,
223673710,1339,Issue,"I'll take a look over it, and make any comments I might have :question: on but I'll leave all final merges, decisions, etc to  and co.",,,,,,
223736471,1339,Issue,"These 2 new calls actually belong under the `AssigneesClient`.  The API documentation [here] shows existing calls like ""List Available Assignees"" and ""Check Assignees"" which are implemented in this client already, so now these 2 new preview methods ""Add assignees to issue"" and ""Remove assignees from issue"" have been added, they should be added to this `AssignessClient` as well, not to `IssuesClient` directly.I also am not sold on having a special `IssueAssignees` class that inherits `Issue` and adds the new `Assignees` property.  There are plenty of other examples where a particular field is on a response object and can sometimes be `null` depending on which API call was made or other factors... but we dont want to have too much split in the object model and have all these special objects that extend the base one and just add one field.  So I would suggest simpy adding the `Assignees` property to `Issue` model object.  The new assignees field is also going to be returned on the [""Create an Issue""] and [""Edit an Issue""] calls on IssuesClient, and I'd actually be quite surprised if it also wasn't going to be returned on the ""List Issues"" and ""Get a single issue"" methods.  The API docs don't indicate they have the preview functionality at the moment but it could even be a missed API doc update... or perhaps they really dont return the new field now, but surely in the future it must be planned (why wouldnt you want to know multiple assignees details when listing issues?!).  Therefore if we include `Assignees` on the `Issue` object, we wont need to change anything in the future if thoe calls do start returning the infoOn a side note, I've got some local changes done for the Create and Edit issue calls, I might send a pull request to your fork  and then you can pull them into this PR?",,,,,,
223737594,1339,Issue,"I'd actually be quite surprised if it also wasn't going to be returned on the ""List Issues"" and ""Get a single issue"" methodsOK so I just did some poking... I added `Assignees` field to the `Issue` model class, and added the new preview header to the `IssuesClient.Get()` and `IssuesClient.GetAllForRepository()` calls and the new field IS populated in the response object :tada:   So definitely go with including this on the base issue and we can also set the accepts header on the Get/List calls.     could you possibly find out if an API docs update was missed for the Get and List issues calls supporting the new multiple assignees and taking the preview header?",,,,,,
223743963,1339,Issue,Ok. Then I roll back and add the `Assignees` property to Issue class. In the meantime i added method to remove assignees,,,,,,

231408854,1339,Issue,"OK, strike my last comment. Issues are returned regardless of whether the user is the first assignee or not.It was actually a filter in our code that excluded the issues, since it was examining `Issue.Assignee` which is indeed the first assignee.I've worked around it for now, and I can see that this PR adds `Issue.Assignees` so all is good.",,,,,,
234722356,1339,Issue,I would come back to this issue and have one question. In the `IssuesClient` it is possible to add `Assignees` in the `Create` and `Edit` method and also to get assignees in payloads for `Get` methods if we add the preview header for multiple assignees. But it is also possible to get a `reactions summary payload` if we add the accept header for `reactions`. So now the question how to add multiple `accept headers` for that calls?,,,,,,

234768359,1339,Issue,"Thanks for that Info :thumbsup: So I will remove that accept headers. And I correct my comment from yesterday. Maybe it it's ok in such a situation where we have to add multiple accept headers if we do something like this `AcceptHeaders.X + "","" + AcceptHeaders.Y`",,,,,,

262766555,1339,Issue,"Agreed.  After chatting with  we agreed to let my label changes go in, although as mentioned above,we want to add a `RemoveLabel()` helper function on `IssueUpdate` to remove a single label from the list, so users aren't ever needing to directly manipulate the list contents.  Are you ok to do that   ?",,,,,,

268691145,1339,Issue,Can we add support for multiple-assignees in PullRequest.cs as well? It ought to be basically the same as the change for Issue.cs.I desperately need this change for my app! 😄,,,,,,
268775912,1339,Issue,"As far as the GitHub API is structured, PullRequests are the same as Issues regarding core concepts such as retrieving comments, assigning, labeling etc.  There is no separate API for PullRequests for these things, you actually just use the Issues API to do them for PullRequests tooSo the good news is your change is already done.  The bad news is we STILL havent merged this, sorry!  I have xmas holidays after tomorrow and will definitely get ontop of the couple of PRs I need to review ;)",,,,,,

268970252,1339,Issue,"yes I see what you're saying although the github API docs don't show that field on pull request objects.

271291180,1339,Issue,are you able to tick the box to enable me to push commits into this PR?  I've done some testing of this and written a couple of integration tests and also found that a couple of changes were needed to actually make this work!,,,,,,
271547081,1339,Issue,"Thanks, Ive pushed up a few commits - added integration tests for `IssueUpdate.Assignees` usage- fixed issue where `Assignees` and `Assignee` can't both be specified on the request.  API docs indicate `Assignee` is deprecated, so I have `[Obsoleted]` this field, and stopped including it in `Issue.ToUpdate()`- I also ended up implementing the `Assignees` field on `PullRequest` response object since it was quick/easy are you able to review my changes and confirm the integration tests are running for you?",,,,,,

You need to set the custom accept header to enable the preview mode so hopefully once that's specified, the search query may work as you want.

I'm definitely not saying you shouldn't work on these but I'd be keen to get a release happening soon.

239758407,1269,Issue,"apologies again for the delay on this - the approach seems fine, added a few commentsDigging into the original PR comment:#### API Uri'sI'm fine with isolating that rewriting behaviour as near to the Management Console functionality as possible. We might have a better idea for handling it down the track.#### AuthenticatingAlso fine. [Just something we need to live with, it seems.] The irksome thing is that the password is essentiall in clear text on the end of the Url but im not sure if that's really any different to it being in the HTTP headers for regular calls anyway...If you're using HTTPS and everything is setup correctly on the server, after the [initial handshake] between server and client the contents of requests (whether it's the request line or the `Authorization` header) are considered encrypted.#### What the heck is up with parameters containing json strings?!!Gosh that's some beautiful API design :trollface: If anyone is able to show me how to get this working in a more ""normal"" way for octokit where the request object is serialized using the builtin `SimpleJsonSerializer` in the normal pipeline, I would love to see what I missed bercause I feel like I tried so many attempts and still couldnt crack it without going the form encoded route.Pretty much all of Octokit's serialization has been built off the assumption you're serializing an object to the request body. This is outside that sandbox, so I think we're stuck for now. If SimpleJson is all you need, perhaps we could make the serializer a first class feature on the client, so the code might look like this:I'd need to think about what that might break in terms of testability by baking it into `ApiClient`, and what other scenarios this would help us cover. Also, are there more scenarios where the JSON sent needs to be wildly flexible beyond our simple serializer attributes? Perhaps this won't be worth investing in...#### What the heck is up with the time handling?!!I'll just leave this here:![]Okay, now to actually be constructive.- When sending a value as part of the request, it sounds like we should be able to send an ISO 8601 string, right?- When receiving a value as part of the response, why bother being clever with the parsing? Just serve it up as a string, if the API is going to try and be clever with what it presents.I've ask the team about this API and whether others have felt the same pain.#### Specifying ""when"" parameter in EditMaintenanceMode()These all seem fair. I'd perhaps drop `FromChronicString` in case it does get obsoleted, but that's a minor feel.#### MaintenanceModeStatus as an enum#### Added environment var for management console password for integration tests:thumbsup: to both",,,,,,
239789418,1269,Issue,thanks for the comments.  Ill revisit this soon with those comments in mind and see what a fresh perspective brings.I think I've already got a branch somewhere where I at least used the serializer to build the JSON string but from memory I still couldnt get it to be accepted in the request body and had to go with the URLEncoded approach.,,,,,,
240091827,1269,Issue,"OK I think all comments have been addressed I've also changed the request object side of things so the structure matches what the API expects, and I can use `SimpleJsonSerializer` to build the json string.  The usage is now `new MaintenanceUpdate(new MaintenanceUpdateDetails(true, ""next tuesday at 5pm""))` - the nested class isn't ideal but that's how the API object needs to be (ie top level item name `maintenance` that then contains the `enabled`/`when` attributes).I still need to UrlFormEncode the request rather than have it in the request body, so Ive made a new class similar to `RequestParameters` that helps with this and can be used on future ones too (eg the management console settings API).  So at least it's now using a consistent/standard approach to generating the encoded parameters and using the SimpleJsonSerializer too",,,,,,

206361148,1245,Issue,"how can i make sure my test are passing? do i need to make a separate testing account for this? thanks. yeah you should create a test account because the integration tests do things like create repos and other things.  Generally they try to clean up after themselves where possible, but definitely you want a separate test account to do this under.Refer to the integration test sectino in [Contributors Guide] for information about how to run the tests (essentially there's a powershell script to help you define those environment variables)",,,,,,

206413242,1245,Issue,"Im not in a position to pull your code down and run it myself just now, but eyeballing your changes, yes that looks correct in specifying the accept header on the `ApiConnection.Put` call.  The real test is whether your integration tests succeed, and the merged PR was squashed rather than merged!However on the unit test mock verification you shouldnt use `AcceptHeaders.xxxxx` there (instead hardcode the expected header string) - we want the unit test to independently verify the implementation code, so we dont want to ""share"" that `AcceptHeaders` helper between implementation and tests (otherwise a bug/typo in the helper class will still pass the unit test!).  Same way we manually check the Url that is called rather than use the `ApiUrl` helper method :grinning: Regarding the integration test assertion, is there also a way to verify the commitTitle specified was correctly applied?",,,,,,

And finally, do a force push.",,,,,,
219687814,1245,Issue,i want to get back on this. i have free time for a while :smile: . I need a little help.regarding passing the `Header` in put request i think i need to pass it in `PullRequestClient.Merge` . This merge method returns `PullRequestMerge` model object. In return statement the put method takes 4 input arguments. The one which confuses me the 3rd parameter `string twoFactorAuthenticationCode` Should i pass null here? or dummy text or i should update the position of parameters in overloaded `put` in `IConnection` class so that make `Accept Header` third input parameter and leave `twoFactorAuthenticationCode` without initializing it.![capture1],,,,,,
219722693,1245,Issue,The one which confuses me the 3rd parameter string `twoFactorAuthenticationCode` Should i pass null here? You can specify `null` fine here. or i should update the position of parameters in overloaded put in IConnection class so that make Accept Header third input parameter and leave twoFactorAuthenticationCode without initializing it.Don't reorder the parameters as part of this PR.

207012136,1244,Issue,"So I like the CoreFx coding style with a few extra changes. Let me elaborate:- We use `_camelCase` for internal and private fields and use readonly where possibleThis is helpful to understand context quickly when dealing with large, complex classes with lots of internal fields and variables. But I don't feel Octokit is at that stage (nor should it be aiming for that). We have lots of small classes composed together, and for the most part the fields we use can be made `readonly` which is the big headache with mixing fields and local variables (accidentally setting a field instead of a variable).So I'd simplify this to **""We use `camelCase` for internal and private fields and use readonly where possible""**- We always specify the visibility, even if it's the defaultAgain, this is a noise versus value thing for me. I like removing `private` wherever it comes up as that's the default visibility.I'd change this to **Specify the visibility unless it is private, in which case it should be removed**",,,,,,
207136172,1244,Issue,"So do you think it's feasible to essentially have our own copy of that md file, with our preferred tweaks, then reinforce it with convention tests? Eg it should be easy enough to have tests that make sure `private` visibility is not specified and variable names never contain underscores",,,,,,
207152136,1244,Issue,so I'm pretty sure I can adapt the `.vssettings` file from corefx to address those two. And I guess the R# rules file. I think those alongside with adding this to CONTRIBUTING.md (or something similar) should be good enough.I'll let others chime in here before I do anything about it.,,,,,,
205623455,1243,Issue,"This is kinda interesting because if you look at the actual [API response data] it doesnt include any information about the repository that we even COULD populate into octokit.  There is a `repository_url` field, that is not currently deserialized into the octokit.net response models for `Issue` but then if you were happy to parse a URL field there are already plenty (`Url`, `HtmlUrl`, `CommentsUrl`, `EventsUrl`) to choose from...Although your suggestion makes sense from a usability point of view, it doesn't seem appropriate for octokit ~~to make multiple API calls behind the scenes~~ (edit: im not even sure there IS an api call that can tell you the repo an issue came from?!), nor do we want to ""invent"" fields on entities that arent actually returned from the API ( will correct me if I'm wrong on this, as I do think we have a couple of calculated fields here and there...)The [Search API] is the same - it doesn't include org or repo information on the returned issue responses.It's weird when you think about it, since exactly as you've pointed out, whenever dealing with ""`Issue`"" objects, you no longer easily know where they came from!I guess at the moment I'd tend towards calling `GetAllForOrganization()` then parsing the repo from the `Url` or `HtmlUrl` field, rather than calling ""GetAllForRepository()"" on each of the 51 repos...",,,,,,
205624421,1243,Issue,"Url parsing is what I meant when I said there's no _easy_ way to tell which repo an issue came from. ;)Also I agree it doesn't make sense for octokit to do another API call behind the scenes, since I was trying to avoid excess API calls to begin with.I guess the problem then is at the API layer and maybe this problem could be elevated to them?",,,,,,
205632131,1243,Issue,"yeah maybe  or  can escalate that one internally, though I guess any of us can also send github commentary/request like this externally tooI agree with your sentitment although id say ""there is no ~~easy~~cringe-free way"" since parsing the url is ""easy"" just makes us cringe hehe :trollface:",,,,,,
205769439,1243,Issue,"A quick test indicates `repository` should be available at the `GetAllForCurrent` endpoint. I'd need to test `GetAllForOrganization` as well but don't have the right setup to confirm this right now:Whether we should bake this into Octokit.NET however, I'm not so sure. It might be considered undocumented behaviour...",,,,,,
205850196,1243,Issue,"Ah I should have thought about that as I encountered similar things (eg fields present in responses that aren't shown in the doco) like on GHE when ldap is enabled, user/org responses contain an ldap_dn field I reckon if it's in the json response we can put it in octokit. Worst case it ends up null if the field is ever not there anymore but it seems extremely unlikely that would happen?",,,,,,

205533596,1242,Issue,"Useful info thanks. Perhaps we could treat it like obsoleting items where we remove things a number of releases after they are no longer supported/needed.

Im not sure in your situation with the added complexity of one of those email addresses already belonging to ""another"" github user (ie your 2econd account).  Perhaps if you change that account's email address first, then add both email addresses to your main account.  Alternatively, just change your VS settings so the email address is the right one and not worry about the historic commits (although its always nice to have all your commits against your own account so the contributors page is accurate!)",,,,,,

Clearly the programmer made a mistake.They either should set `options` to something, or just omit that argument. Having two overloads makes that clear.",,,,,,

Why is that so?Because `ApiOptions.None` is just a plain old instance of `ApiOptions`, testing for a specific instance is tricky. You _could_ check it has the default values set, but as the whole purpose of the class is to just carry around values, I didn't really focus on it here.Our helper  `Args.ApiOptions` is just a wrapper around `Args.Any()` - if you wanted to test for specific values on `ApiOptions` you could use `Arg.Any o.Page == 2)` to make this clearer.

My take is, as long as the PR has made the class consistent (ie all cases of private members are using underscore notation) that it is OK and actually means we are standardising towards the coreFx standards.In this case there is only 1 private variable so the change does look isolated but at the same time, it IS consistent (as the entire file is now using underscore notation).  Although the entire PR is not consistent because the regular client integration tests have 2 cases of local class variables which werent converted to underscore notation (only the reactive client tests were).

Other things I considered were doing something in the `FormatUri()` extension method, or having a convention test that checked the endpoint Uris in `ApiArls.cs` helper class... but in both cases that didn't protect against a contribution that doesnt use the helper class or extension method (assuming we dont pull up the contributor in the PR and ask them to use the helper class and extension method).  Then we have the other situation of any consumers of octokit that are using the `client.Connection.Get` etc methods, and passing in their own endpoint Uri.  Perhaps we dont need to ""stop"" them since they can fix their code (although whether they would know that the HTTP 406 is because the Uri fragments got eaten due to a leading slash, and not being able to easily debug right down into the guts of the octokit plumbing, it would lead to much hair pulling!!).But yeah my main concern was the fact we can inadvertently break API methods from working on Enterprise and it doesnt get picked up in tests or at runtime.  We could throw an exception I guess (again, that's too late if we've shipped the release though!).

We've been rather slow with releases lately (~1 month and ~2 months between the last three releases) but if we get moving to a more frequent cadence of releases (hint: yes, we should) then we can re-evaluate this and perhaps move to a time-based approach.",,,,,,

On one hand, $vendor may need to support obsolete features in an API until the next major release. On the other hand, some OSS library may choose to ignore SemVer and arbitrarily introduce breaking changes because move fast and break stuff.Technically we're pre-1.0 so SemVer is not very opinionated about this, but I'd favour being more conservative in general.

There are already lots of overloads on GetResponse etc so we should only add them if absolutely necessary.  Im not sure if in this case it was necessary or just a convenience?Similarly with the singleton for ApiOptions.None - performance improvement is surely negligible and not really a major concern.  The other point about unit testing... we have plenty of examples of `Model` classes that need to be compared in Unit Tests and some discussions have occured around implementing `IEquality` for Model classes or using extension/comparison methods etc.  Im not sure that the singleton approach for this one specific edge case (so that you can use object equality of `options == ApiOptions.None`) is worth it?I defer to  for opinion on both matters, I am mainly coming at it from the point of ""if this is the first time we are introducing something"" it should be thought about in the context of the whole project and not just this PR",,,,,,

196087192,1146,Issue,"Me right now:![] We could add the concept that a comment made on an issue/PR with specific wording, can ""set"" what the release notes should say for that issue.I like this - I'm fine with reading all the issues for this syntax - we can also look at the author to ensure it's someone trusted (whatever that means) If not present it could either fail the release notes process, or fall back to using the actual issue title For example, if the issue is ""Error xxxxx when loading my public repositories"" we might make a comment sayingYeah, the PR titles often need a bit of love. I wouldn't fail the process here. Just grab the title and use it as a placeholder, e.g. `""CLARIFY: Error xxxxx when loading my public repositories""` this could be even further extended for example if there was a comment for ""breaking changes"" then I'm still not settled on a syntax for breaking changes in the release notes (I'd rather explain things in a human friendly way), so perhaps we should just use a label to flag PRs that have breaking changes and see what happens next? Should every PR be associated with an issue or do we need to handle release notes sometimes being for a PR item and other times being for one (or more) fixed issues via a PR?Let's not assume every PR has an issue associated with it. The IDs I use in the release notes are for the PR, as the contribution is the thing I care about here. So let's continue down that path. For each PR/issue we can get the commits/authors so we can continue the tradition of  each author against that line itemIf we're going to script this, we should look at the author of the PR commits as well as the person who opened the PR. If  wants to mention anybody who ""assisted"" even if that was reporting an issue or taking part in review/discussions, we could also build up a list of commenters on all the PR's in a release then have a general ""thanks to the following who were part of helping with this release"" or something similar at the end of the release notesYES.

196103966,1146,Issue,"One little thing that I don't have a good answer for is how multiple PRs can span a feature. But let's cross that bridge later.I guess you are referring to here to a large body of work (eg implementing your API Pagination changes) that is implemented via multiple PRs?  In some ways I wonder if just having each PR be listable is ok - eg ""Added pagination support to xxx client""  ""added pagination support to yyy client"".  Is there a need to group these together?  if so some possibilities would be:- use more feature labels - like feature-pagination and then that allows you to further group the PRs under the features area, into higher level features (eg pagination in that case)- use a single issue for the parent feature and link to it in the multiple PRs- use an optional milestone to relate multiple PRs - if milestone is set you can group or consolidate PRs for that milestone into their own subsection (or single line item with comma separated PR numbers)",,,,,,
196113942,1146,Issue,"Is there a need to group these together?Perhaps, perhaps not. Here's a recent example from `v0.19`: Add support for Visibility and Affiliation to repository search - #1096, #1132 via , The first PR was to implement the feature, and the second was to address a regression that was introduced not caught during review. I didn't feel that the second PR warranted it's own line as it was within the context of the same release.That's kind of how I feel about the upcoming pagination PRs - having a separate entry for each PR feels noisy, and I'd rather roll it all up into one item to summarize.Out of those suggestions, the milestone one actually feels the best fit - I'll have a bunch of issues which are all linked to that initial feature, and I don't want to publish this release until it's all merged. We could look for a milestone and group items in that way separate to all this - or just ""squash"" together the PRs and contributors into a single item...Thoughts?",,,,,,

It'll reduce the number of times we might have double notes (issue and associated PR) and it keeps us in the discipline of always submitting a PR for changes.I don't think we need to worry about ""trusted"" authors. Instead, when we review a PR that should have a release note, we can simply edit any comment that has the release note to fit what we want. In fact, the release note should be part of the review and we should encourage PR submitters to try and articulate what the note should be and then we can edit it if it needs editing.BTW, I :heart: where this is going.

Ideally we will do this as we go, but for this time around I'll go back to all the merged PR's and add it.

195861243,1144,Issue,"Hey  thanks heaps for the contribution!  Ive done a first pass review and made several comments... Hopefully you don't think Im being overly picky!  This is a fantastic contribution and in general you've nailed all the key elements - eg standard and observable implementations, great unit and integration tests, added any new files to all the csproj projects and so on.  In terms of the feedback ive commented - most are around tidy up things like whitespace and I also highlighted a couple of things around consistency in naming/doc - eg http vs https on API doc links, or using `organizationName` rather than `org` for the parameters.   I realize that there are already some instances of inconsistencies within octokit in these areas but I guess my approach is when adding new work to try to conform with the ""majority"" consistency, and then hopefully we will also start to tackle the minority items that are inconsistent.  You also seem to have made a couple of inadvertent edits to the csproj files around nuget package version and app.config binding redirects etc.To address a couple of specific things:- Your comment about integration tests not running - it looks like you're setting ""octokit"" org in the test fixture, whereas you should be using a specific integration testing organization that you setup for yourself (accessed via the `Helper` class).  I made a more detailed comment in the location where this was being done- With unit tests, when there are parameters that are being checked for empty strings as well as null (eg `Ensure.ArgumentNotNullOrEmptyString(organizationName)`) you should add a unit test that verifies that.  So in your case, you've added the `EnsuresNonNullArguments()` unit test, but you could also add a `EnsuresNonEmptyArguments()` test that checks the exceptions are thrown when `""""` are passed in for the various arguments that shouldn't be allowed (such as the `org` name).  If you search the code base, there should be some other examples of that if you need to see.- Your [PleaseReview] comments about NotNull assertions on HookId are not required, as hookId being an `int` can never be `null` :grinning:",,,,,,

196313358,1141,Issue,"Hey  Great job getting a good head start on this :grinning:  Implementing a whole new ""client"" is a pretty maojr job, so there are quite a few things we'll need to cover to get you over the line!  We really appreciate your contribution so please don't be put off by the following feedback, I'm trying to make it as detailed and explanatory as possible so that we can quickly get you into the ""mindset"" of an octokit developer :rocket:#### API Client StructureWe try to structure the API clients in octokit to be inline with the GitHub API.  If you have a look at the sidebar in the API docs, the `Migrations` client lives under a menu item called `Migration` and does not belong under the `Enterprise` API.This means, you actually need to create a ""IMigrationClient"" that lives in `IGitHubClient`, then a `IMigrationClient` that lives in `MigrationsClient`.  Yes this is confusing since there is Migration->Migrations and also confusing since the docs refer to it as the `Enterprise Migration API`, but we live and die by the API structure in the sidebar, therefore when using Octokit we should match that structure.  eg `client.Migrations.Migration.Start()`As an aside, it looks like this Migration/Migrations API actually got moved to this top level location late February, previously it was under the `Organizations` API.  I see there is also a new `Source Import` API under `Migration` that I will raise an issue for shortly!#### Naming things (TM)If you have a look at some other `Client` APIs for inspiration, you'll see there are some naming conventions in Octokit which should be consistent.  For example, since it's the `Migrations` API, you wouldnt call the `List Migrations` method `GetMigrations()` (since that would be `client.Migration.Migrations.GetMigrations()` !!! ).  We normally name the ""list"" methods `Get()` (for a single instance) `GetAll()` (for all instances) and `GetAllForCurrent()` (for all instances for the current user, when it's something a user can own, like repositories, publickeys etc.  So i'd suggest the names for the methods in this API should beStart a migration: `Start()`List of migrations: `GetAll()`Status of migration: `Get()`Download migration archive: `GetArchive()`Delete migration archive: `DeleteArchive()`Unlock repository: `UnlockRepository()`#### Order of MethodsIn a similar line of thought, I personally try to have the ""order"" of the method calls in my client, match those shown in the API.  So in your case, you've listed them as Status, List, Start, Download, Delete, Unlockwhereas the API docs list them in a slightly different order Start, List, Status, Download, Delete, UnlockPersonally I'd prefer to match the order to the API docs as it makes it easier to review and check for completeness etc :grinning:#### Other Notes- Dont forget to set the custom accepts header to enable this preview functionality, otherwise it wont actually work when you do it ""for real"".  Have a look at the `AcceptHeaders.ProtectedBranchesApiPreview` as an example on how to do this.  Basically you will add a new entry into that `AcceptHeaders` helper class, then on your API methods you will need to pass that accept header to the `ApiConnection.Post/Get/Delete` methods  ![image]- With your serialization problem, the tiniest little things can sometimes cause so much trouble!!!    If you have a look at all other `Response` model objects, you will notice they have a default/parameterless constructor!  That's all your problem boils down to... 1 line!  haha :sob:     Internally the `SimpleJsonSerializer` builds up that `ConstructorCache` and in your `Migration` class, it can't find a constructor to use, since you only provided one that takes all the parameters!  Adding a default constructor should get you past this hurdle!  `public Migration() { }`.  Same issue will be with your `StartMigrationRequest` request object.  If you want to have a unit test that tests the deserialization, it will need a default ctor",,,,,,
196327542,1141,Issue,"Thanks for the detailed feedback. I was also eagerly waiting for someone to get me into the ""mindset"". Now that I know much better about the philosophy of Octokit, I'll adhere to it. ... Migrations client lives under a menu item called Migration and does not belong under the Enterprise API. This means, you actually need to create a ""IMigrationClient"" that lives in IGitHubClient, then a IMigrationClient that lives in MigrationsClient...Thankfully, it came up before running `.\build.cmd FixProjects`I know it my fault that I didn't first checked the docs, but since you said an Enterprise instance is needed for this, I just assumed it is a part of Enterprise API. I'll keep this in mind in the future.Also, a question, does it mean we have to create an IMigrationsClient and an ISourceImportClient (may be in the future) inside an IMigrationClient and that will go under the IGitHubClient?

Also, a question, does it mean we have to create an IMigrationsClient and an ISourceImportClient (may be in the future) inside an IMigrationClient and that will go under the IGitHubClient?Yep!  I think this is the first time they've given us 2 such similarly named things as parent/child, but the structure is a ""Migration"" entry, with ""Migrations"" and ""Source Import"" under that.

197855256,1141,Issue,"Yeah, I mentioned earlier it is confusing since they doi call it the ""Enterprise Migrations API"" but with octokit.net, we base the Clients class structure on the API structure (as shown in the sidebar on the doc site) and not the name... so `GitHubClient.Migration.Migrations` is what you should go with (and similarly move all the models, tests etc out of the `Enterprise` folders)",,,,,,

199795537,1141,Issue,"So, what should I do?The mentions of ""Enterprise Migrations"" is only at the landing page for the parent ""Migration"" page.  Everywhere else shows ""Migrations"" - eg the URL, the sidebar, the actual page title etc.  This seems to be the first example I can find where the ""title"" of an API as shown on it's parent's landing page is not consistent with it's name in the side bar and on it's own page!This API was already only recently moved/relocated to this spot, so I assume this is it's new home now, and if anything it may be losing the ""Enterprise"" nomenclature... Perhaps  or  can get the inside word on whether this is being renamed ""to"" or ""away"" from ""Enterprise"" Migrations API on it's parent page?This is the only place it's called ""Enterprise Migrations""Everywhere else it's just ""Migrations""I think your latest revision is great though - `IMigrationClient` being the top level parent, and `IMigrationsClient` being the lower level migrations API.  The amusing thing is that due to our policy in octokit of naming the API client property in the singular, we still end up with `client.Migration.Migration.GetAll()` :sob: But I do think the way you've got it now is the most consistent and inline with the standards set throughout octokit (rather than breaking the singular property naming rule or calling it EnterpriseMigration eventhough its not called that in most places in the doc)...  so Im happy with how it's ended up!",,,,,,

205272870,1141,Issue,"Hey  , sorry for the delay in getting to this one.  Ive made a number of comments against file diffs for you to go through which should give you some pointers.Regarding the integration tests, there are a few things here:- they currently are creating a lot of migration requests - eg almost every test is requesting a migration of all repo's in the configured organization.- they also assume the organization HAS repos which potentially may not be the case...- the download archive method - I think you cant download the archive until the migration status is ""exported"".  I had to add a while loop to that test, sleep for a few seconds and check the status again (using `GetMigration`) until it reported ""exported"" and then I was able to call the DownloadArchive function.  - the DownloadArchive API call issues a redirect to the download link for the archive, andoctokit automatically follows redirects.  In my case at least, this was an 80+MB file (as i had a clone of octokit.net repo in my test organisation) and took a few minutes to downloadFor the tests to be succesful and efficient we cant rely on or pre-suppose any existence of data, beyond the information provided through integration test setup (ie user, password, apikey, organization).  So ideally we want to create whatever data we need for the tests, and wherever possible we want to clean up after ourselves as well (eg who wants to have 100s or 1000s of repos in their test org, because they ran the test a number of times).  Luckily we have some examples in octokit of doing this, and some helper classes and methods to help you out :grinning: We want to use the ""CreateTheWorld()"" type approach, that we are using in some other ingration tests (a good one to look at is `MergingClientTests.cs` .  We'll essentially have a single test class for this `MigrationsClientTests` with a constructor that will setup all the data it needs (eg repositories, content in those repositories and kick off the migration).  Then you will have the normal test methods you've already written for the other methods, and finally implement `IDisposable` and clean up after ourselves where we can (eg we can delete the repos but we cant really stop the pending migrations, however it could be that deleting the repos deletes those migrations anyway, we'll have to see).  It shouldnt be a big deal anyway since the API docs say that any created migration archives are removed after 7 days anyway, so the main thing for me is that our test repos get removed once we're done.We have helper classes for `RepositoryContext` and an extension method on `IGitHubClient` that can create these temporary repositories, and they implement `IDisposable` which will then delete the repositories on github.com when the tests wind up (well more precisely, when your test class Dispose() method calls Dispose() on the contexts).  You can steal/borrow some code from the `CreateTheWorld()` implementation in MergingClientTests.cs to populate those repos with a couple of commits/content so they arent empty... and the last thing to do in the constructor phase, is actually initiate the migration request (since all the other test methods need a migration to be requested).Then have your normal test methods, to run through the `Get`, `GetAll`, `DownloadArchive` (remembering to check/wait for appropriate exported status) and `UnlockRepository` test methods, against that list of created/known repositories.  (although the usual approach is a separate test class per method, in situation like this I reckon it's OK to make all the test methods in the one class, so they can use the contexts setup in the constructor.  Another option would be to have the test method classes, inherit the base class, so they can access the contexts... either would work.Implement `IDisposable` on the test class, so you can override `Dispose()` and explicitly dispose the contexts (which will delete the repositories from the user's test organization on github.com) and will hopefully leave things mostly tidy over many test ezxecutions.I've knocked up a [quick gist] to demonstrate what I'm talking about.",,,,,,

206364005,1141,Issue,"Also question for  ... should the `status` field be implemented as an enum in octokit?Im thinking yes, since we have things like `ItemState` as an enum, eventhough the api returns that as a text field.

It doesn't really make sense to me, to use an enum called `ItemStateFilter` (that s described as being used for search filtering) on all of these objects and new/update message classes.  It looks like pretty much the ONLY place that seems to allow `All` as an option to `State` is the List Issues/Milestones/Pull Requests type calls.So Im wondering if perhaps we should:- Keep `ItemState` enum but flag the `All` value as `[Deprecated]` (to be removed in future)- Keep using this `ItemState` enum on all the existing places such as `Issue` `Milestone` and `PullRequest` objects and the `NewXXX` `UpdateXXX` request classes for them- Introduce the new `ItemStateFilter` enum, allowing `open,closed,all` and use it only on the `XXXRequest`` classes that are used for the ""list"" methodsThat means less ""overall"" change, and the more sensible approach that `ItemState` is used for actual items and creating/updating them... whilst the `ItemStateFilter` is used when listing them",,,,,,
195925920,1140,Issue,"So basically, just reverse the names of the enum !! :P",,,,,,

Your latest changes show `IssueUpdate` `MilestoneUpdate` `NewMilestone` and `PullRequestUpdate` classes as all using `ItemStateFilter` but shouldn't they be using `ItemState` since only `open` and `closed` are valid values for all of these?",,,,,,

Could even fail the release process if any item it needs to include, doesnt have this ""field"" on it.  You can also ""lock it down"" so that only certain user's comments will be seen as valid ""release_notes"" text and so on.This can then be maintained as we groom/merge PRs and close issues etc, so the actual process of creating release notes doesnt involve any rewording or massaging and can eventually be fully automated",,,,,,

193552106,1133,Issue,"Hey  thanks for contributing the fix and this is a great opportunity for you to gain experience in the area of open source contributions and familiarity with mock based unit testing! :)The purpose of the Octokit.net unit tests is to verify expected behaviour but run totally self contained locally (ie not calling out to any github.com api calls and the like).  So the `NSubstitute` mocks are used to mock out any of these expensive/external API calls so that the tests run quickly and against controlled data.Mocks help us achieve the Unit Testing ""Arrange, Act, Assert"" pattern.  - Arrange is where we setup our input data and configure our mocks  (ie, ""when you receive a call that looks like this, reply with this data"") - Act is where we make the call we are actually testing- Assert is where we then use our mocks or the returned data to make various assertions about what we expected to happen (which throw an exception and fail the test if the conditions we test for didnt occur)  (ie, ""assert that when I called the `Users.GetAll()` client call, the underlying httpConnection received a `Get(...)` call with parameters that contain specific values we wanted (like the expectedUrl, input parameters etc)""So anyway, the reason those tests are now failing is that the substituted `IJsonSerializer` is now correctly passed through thanks to your fix, meaning that down in the guts of constructing the http call to the API, the ""data"" of the response body is null (because the substitute hasnt been configured to return  any data when `Serialize()` is called on it).  This means that the Assert on `httpClient.Send()` is failing, since it did not receive a call that matched what we specified (specifically, the body data is now null rather than it being """" as expected)-Zuber 's example is setting the expected body data to be the (null) return of the mocked serializer... which does make the test pass, however I would probably recommend instead to configure the mock to return the data we want since that is more in keeping with the unit testing approach and would also be applicable in other situations where we had a ""real"" body instead of a `new object()` as in this case.  We can also add an assert to ensure that the `IJsonSerializer` `Received()` 1 call to `Serialize()` thus proving it was correctly passed through.Does that give you enough information  to tackle correcting the failing unit tests yourself?To give an example of how I would probably fix these unit tests (explanatory comments like this aren't required, im just adding them to walk you through what's happening):",,,,,,

193119245,1128,Issue,Sorry about this...,,,,,,
193119051,1121,Issue,I'd love to hear a bit more about what you're trying to do. Please have a read of [this section] of our README and open a new issue with some more details...,,,,,,
193025073,1120,Issue,"Some initial thoughts:- the `/repositories/:id/` is not included in the response payload for a repository, e.g.  or - the only place I can find a mention of this is in the [search results API]- I can see `octokit.rb` has support for passing an `Integer` [here]. I can't see an equivalent for `octokit.objc` but perhaps I'm not looking in the right spot. If one desires to build an application that is resilient to change (e.g., repositories changing names, changing owners, owners changing name, etc.) then the application should be built against the repositories API rather than the repos API.This should be covered by the [API supporting redirects] which Octokit now follows correctly.   This is still not great though as it can race and lead to very unexpected behavior if you are in the middle of a complex transaction (spanning multiple API calls) when the repository moves out from under you.I'd love to hear more about this scenario and what you're looking to build here. With most of our operations (whether returning a task or an observable) we're interested in getting the data as soon as possible. If that scenario isn't suitable for your use case, perhaps there's something we can be doing in Octokit to address this.",,,,,,
193027652,1120,Issue,"Unfortunately, I am pretty sure that repository redirects can be subverted by new repositories and new users.  If I create `Zoltu/Foo`, then rename it to `Zoltu/Bar`, I can then create a new `Zoltu/Foo`.  If someone tries to go to `Zoltu/Foo` before I created the new `Zoltu/Foo` they will correctly be redirected. If they try to navigate to `Zoltu/Foo` after I create the new repository though they will be taken to the new repository.To make matters worse, in the case of a name change a malicious user can actually mount an attack.  Lets say `Google` decides to change their name to `Abc` within the GitHub organization.  If they don't have the foresight to also create a new user to reclaim the `Google` name then a malicious user can create a user named `Google` and copy all of `Google`'s repositories over from `Abc`.  Now they can inject subtle backdoors, security holes, etc. into every repository and anyone who is going to `Google/Foo` (because they have a bookmark or old link in a blogpost etc) they will instead get `Google/Foo` + evil code.See: You are right, the `/repositories/:id` endpoint is not documented well, and I am not sure why that is.  I can only assume it is because most users are familiar with the `owner/name` nomenclature and having a second endpoint with an `id` that no one ever sees could be confusing to new API users.As for what I am doing in my project, I am maniuplating repository objects via the GitHub API, primarily because library support for the GitHub API is superior to library support for the git protocol (which is a separate can of worms).  In this case, interacting with a git repository via Octokit from an application is significantly easier than trying to use something like libgit2 (or any of the wrappers around it), especially when you want to work with the repository in-memory (not clone to disk).The most important bit for my scenario is that I am saving repository references in my own database for extended periods of time that would make my application susceptible to the above type of attack.  At the least, I would need to save the `id` and resolve it to an `owner/repo` before doing any real work (which occurs over the span of about a minute).  This would limit the surface area of an attack down to a small enough window of time that it is no longer an immediate problem.Perhaps as a middle-ground, there could be a single method in Octokit that allows me to resolve an `id` into a `owner/repo`?  I believe at the moment I am going to have to manually hit the API (without Octokit) in order to do that resolution before proceeding to use Octokit.",,,,,,
193034434,1120,Issue,"thanks for the extra information - and yes, there are certainly ways to subvert the process.I had a chat with one of the API team just now and he told me that we intend to support `/repositories/:id` (even if it isn't documented) in the long term. I think I'm going to spin this out into a GSoC task for someone who is interested in contributing - unless someone else wants to claim it...",,,,,,

I know that application period starting since 15 March and I will send my proposal after this date with usage of application form, but I have done some investigation of this task right now.I think that we could create overloaded method that use repository Id as main parameter for each method that use owner and repo name as their parameters. This is  example:I found about 29 client interfaces in Octokit project that use owner and name of repository parameters, so we could create overload for each of theirs methods (I have counted about 175 methods in these interfaces).I think that usage of such overloads is more preferable  than creation some kind of abstract concept of Repo (as was suggested by  in first message), because we get more simple and clean interfaces.So, my proposal is create overload for each method that use owner and name parameters now and create test case for each of them.",,,,,,

194686607,1116,Issue,"Okay, I have read the mentioned issues, I understand about how things have been proceeded so far and agree with all of the points made by  and . I also get the type of abstractions has been planned. And after almost a week of reading docs, timing out tests, digging through the code, and following related issues transitively(there were too many), I had some thoughts about this particular topic. So, here I go: - Too many `ctor`'s - While I was going through the issues, I have seen  expressing his views about having already so many `ctor`'s for `GitHubClient` and adding more is not going to help the situation. I think that **default(optional) parameters** can be a possible solution for this. We can something like this:May be **named parameters** can help here. I don't know about the conventions to be followed here or does this even go well with the use cases.- Per-request options -  once [mentioned] about having per-request basis options. Can we use something a like an `ClientOptions` class which may have options for different types of API to be used, e.g. `Release`, `Gist`, `Issue`, which may have different timeouts and some other options to be passed on `HttpClient`. **Will it be feasible?**- And there is a completely different thing in my mind. Can we use  [Refit] for delegating most of our tasks. As we are already talking about having a type of abstraction to de-couple the `HttpClient`, we can completely delegate the HTTP + Serialization work to `Refit`. [Square](square.github.io)'s [Retrofit] uses a similar kind of abstraction (it uses OkHttp for it HTTP work. I don't know about the performance of `Refit`, maybe  can help. Or, we can fork `Refit` and decouple the HTTP and Serialization work and allow anyone to plug in their ISerializer too (which is also possible right now). Note: I know this may sound crazy, but it just occurred to me as I have worked with Retrofit and I really like how its structured.---Please, be gentle with me, I am new to this project. I really respect this your opinion, these are just some of my crazy thoughts. And please, provide feedback on this.",,,,,,
195994093,1116,Issue,"Can you please review this now? I would really like you feedback on this, so that I can get a more clear idea about how to proceed.",,,,,,
196086468,1116,Issue,"Here's some of my thoughts on this:- regarding ""Too many ctor's"" - I believe this we can resolve this as a side-effect of making `HttpClient` a first-class feature. There's a number of `ctor` dependencies in Octokit which we can (and perhaps should) delegate to the HTTP abstraction, such as:  - `BaseAddress`  - `Timeout`  - perhaps even [`Credentials`]?I wouldn't focus on this area first, but instead keep this in mind as you're exploring how we're using the HTTP stack inside Octokit. - per-request options are still something we'll need to support - but I'd recommend keeping this as simple as possible. A `HttpClient` can set it's own `Timeout` which is applied to all requests (irrespective of what we try and set for each request) so I fear we'll have some issues here troubleshooting just what was set for a request.- switching over to Refit or Retrofit means we _might_ be able to clean up some of our plumbing, but I don't think it will really help us out here. They use a different set of conventions for organizing things, and the work required to port things over would be orthogonal to this work around letting users provide their own `HttpClient` instance for our HTTP operations.I guess the thing to bring this thread together is that we've had various requests in the past to be able to plug things into Octokit's HTTP stack, such as [custom caching]:We also introduced following HTTP redirects natively into Octokit in #808 after it became [a feature of the GitHub API], so we know we can customize our plumbing to suit - how we let others do the same is what I'd like to solve here...Hope this helps!",,,,,,
196487638,1116,Issue,"Can we also pull out the serialization part out of Octokit.NET and server as a separate packages?

197229298,1116,Issue,"While on the topic of delegating things to `HttpClient`, should `ProductHeaderValue` be specified in the client or not?

193485272,1115,Issue,"Someone asked me in another channel to summarize .NET Core in relation to the .NET Framework. Here's a quick brain dump:- .NET Core is a subset of the .NET Framework which runs on Windows, Linux,  OSX and other operating systems- The [CoreCLR] (the runtime for .NET Core)  is an open source repository- Core libraries for .NET Core is distributed via NuGet packages - the   [CoreFX] repository has all the source for  the .NET Core libraries- Various APIs have not been ported over to .NET Core  - features which are Windows-specific - e.g. WPF, WinForms  - features which are not suitable for their v1 target of running webapps  - APIs which are not intended to be supported long-term- The other part of this project the [dotnet CLI],  which allows you to build and run programs which target .NET Core from the  command line - this is just now available to test, but not quite v1This is different to the Portable Class Library targets, which were designed to simplify the platforms you targeted, but were limited to where .NET was already running - e.g. Mono/Xamarin/.NET FrameworkOctokit.net already has a PCL profile that's suitable to migrate to .NET Core, so most of the work around this will likely involve migrating to the [project.json] format to define the dependencies and platforms that Octokit needs to support, and also testing to verify that there are no unexpected issues with running on .NET Core so that we're ready to be used when .NET Core 1.0 RTMs",,,,,,
194833253,1115,Issue,"What parts of the project we will be needing to re-write to make this .NET Core compatible? I mean, how much code is there which is .NET Framework specific and not available in .NET Core or is never going to be?",,,,,,

195060079,1115,Issue,"So, the different types of project which target .NET Framework e.g. Octokit, Octokit-Net45, Octokit-Portable, etc. will be unified in a single codebase and `project.json`.

184660739,1106,Issue,"I knew this code lived somewhere Ah right, we even use that `SshKeyClient` at the moment but I was tunnel visioning on the `User.Keys` side of things and didnt think that they are the same thing!  So yes, the methods on ISshKeysClient should be added to IUserKeysClient - and IGitHubClient.SshKey should be marked as obsolete for removal as it doesn't align with the API. i'm in the process of doing this now, all the methods are transferred but I have some questions about the obsolescence stuffI've marked `IGitHubClient.SshKey` obsolete but that doesn't actually flag several use cases...  So should we actually also mark `GitHubClient.SshKey` obsolete (that gets anybody using a `GitHubClient` rather than an `IGitHubClient`).   Then we need of course the `Observable` and `IObservable` versions as well.  Do we go as far to make the actual class `SshKeysClient` or it's interface `ISshKeysClient` obsolete so that anybody who directly creates those clients would get the warning?  Given so many places are required to really catch most use cases, I wonder would it actually be better to simply mark the actual `Get()` `GetAll()` `Create()` `Delete()` methods as obsolete (on the interface and concrete SshKeysClient), that way it doesnt matter whether the consumer uses interfaces or concrete class, the top level client or the low level client... if they invoke any of the methods, they will be advised to move away from them?So apart from the question on the best way to obsolete something, I've also reviewed the associated code/classes and found that the `SshKey` and `SshKeyInfo` classes probably need to be obsoleted as well.The only place `SshKey` is used is within the `SshKeysClient` so once that's obsoleted and eventually removed, it seems the `SshKey` response object should go too?  The `PublicKey` class has all the same fields and is used in `UserKeysClient` which aligns with the API terminology of referring to public keys rather than ssh keys.And how about this [ModelExtensions] class?As per the TODO comment it only deals with SshKeys and should have been renamed to something less generic... but Im more so interested in whether I need to create equivalent extension class/methods for `PublicKey` class (and thus create `PublicKeyInfo` class too) or can these extensions just be dropped (when `SshKey` is dropped, after having been obsolete for a while)?  These `ModelExtensions` are only used in the unit/integration tests (within Octokit) though Im not sure if the intention was that consumers of Octokit would use these helper extension methods to do stuff with the contents of keys?",,,,,,

This seemed preferable than having to have special types when you wanted the ldap field and it shouldnt hurt any non enterprise users having this null property on those objects.Well that's certainly an interesting undocumented feature! Hooray for JSON. Yeah, this seems fair given how the server is behaving. cc  for objections (if any) So I added overrides to `ApiConnection` and `Connection` classes to suit this situation (POST with no body, that returns a `` response object).  Similar to the `RepositoryContext` helper, I added a helper that allows the integration tests to create a team to run the tests, then clean it up afterwards.:thumbsup: `UpdateTeamMapping` - Team must exist (obviously) and specified LDAP distinguished name is NOT validated.  It can be set to something that doesnt exist and is regarded as a succesful API call (and the new LDAP binding is visible in the team settings on the gui etc). (The team will then be disabled on the next LDAP sync when it realises the group is invalid)I'll have a chat with the team and see if this is supposed to be the behaviour here. The integration tests require a GitHub enterprise instance so wont run as part of Octokit builds currently.  Futhermore this API requires the GHE instance has LDAP binding enabled.  Also note that I have had to censor the ""distinguished name"" properties used in the integration tests so they arent company specific.    The integration tests also do NOT run against the ""current user"" because you dont want to mess with changing the LDAP binding on the user running the tests and potenitally disabling the account or otherwise losing access...  So the integration tests have a `_testUser` property declared at the top of the class:thumbsup:  (at the moment that user has to exist, as the method to add users is not implemented... though even when it was, in an LDAP enabled server any user you create would have to have a valid LDAP binding in the first place i suspect!)This seems plausible. But at least this API is now implemented and anyone who wants/needs to use it can.  We just potentially wont have frictionless integration test execution...Yeah, I appreciate the complexities here. Will have a chat with the team and see if they have any thoughts on this so I can also test out LDAP behaviour.",,,,,,

194028859,1097,Issue,"sorry, I should have been more clear. I wanted to put this into the ""Getting Started"" page but there's some setup of the dependencies that `EnterpriseProbe` needs before I can use any code sample for the probe. Do I also do that here, as painful as it is to create these?Or perhaps I could leverage the `GitHubClient` setup and move `EnterpriseProbe` into `GitHubClient`, like this:But that's also kinda backward, as `GitHubClient` requires the base URL...",,,,,,
194029859,1097,Issue,"yeah, that's awkward, EnterpriseProbe requires GitHubClient, not the other way around. In VS I have MEF for this, which basically means that the probe constructor gets the productHeader and httpClient info from MEF, and whoever calls probe gets an instance of EnterpriseProbe through its constructor. That basically boils down to the example you had - do a `new`, await the probe, check the result - but the `new` is split off and done earlier.So I think the example you first posted is appropriate for a simple usage. I think it's more important to clearly show what the return codes mean - Ok, Failed and NotFound - so people know how to handle them. How the EnterpriseProbe instance gets created is really a secondary thing, methinks. We could also have a static Probe method on EnterpriseProbe for a quick one-off, for scenarios where that makes sense.",,,,,,
194415640,1097,Issue,That `Probe.Probe` looks awkward. It's not helped by the fact that `Probe` is both a noun and a verb. What do you think about changing the method name to `Examine` since that's what a probe does.,,,,,,
194415878,1097,Issue,"Another thought, we could simply put the `Probe` method on `Enterprise`.",,,,,,
194416077,1097,Issue,"I kind of like that latter approach better to be honest, but would like to hear others thoughts.",,,,,,
194430851,1097,Issue,"Not to derail the whole thing, but I was looking at it and it feels like this shouldn't actually be a separate class specifically to poke enterprise, at least not as a public API.Correct me if I'm wrong: The goal here is to identify whether the remote server is a github instance, and if it is, whether it's an enterprise instance, right? With that in mind, the solution should probably be a method that returns what type of server it is - dotcom, enterprise, other (not github) or unknown (unable to determine).  Since `GitHubClient` encapsulates server information, the method should probably live here, so something likeThe `EnterpriseProbe` class can be kept as an internal implementation of the probe, and the `GetServerType()` method calls it if the uri is not dotcom.What do you think? (I'm happy to patch up the PR if you agree on this approach, I know you're crazy busy these days)",,,,,,
194436515,1097,Issue,In agreement with  (Someone needs to make a thesaurus for things to say instead of +1 :wink: ),,,,,,
194547704,1097,Issue,"Yeah, I like the direction that  is proposing about internalizing it - you've already specified the URL in the `ctor`, so leave the internal plumbing to Octokit.Other thoughts:- I'm unsure about having the probe returning `DotCom` - this feels a lot like our internal lingo, but as you could invoke this on an instance without the URL set, which would be DotCom behaviour.- What if this were a method off `GitHubClient.Enterprise`? that's originally why we wrote this probing code, and keeping it near there might be more contextual than having it off `GitHubClient`",,,,,,
194558878,1097,Issue,"Not sure why the original code was written like that. In my code, calling EnterpriseProbe always happens together with determining what the server is - so I only call it if it's not a dotcom, and sometimes will check if it's an enterprise for authentication purposes. So enterprise probe is actually just half of the logic of identifying what the server is, and is pretty much always used in that way. By itself is not terribly useful, it needs to be combined with ""is this github.com, yes/no? is this enterprise, yes/no?"" I'm unsure about having the probe returning DotCom - this feels a lot like our internal lingo, but as you could invoke this on an instance without the URL set, which would be DotCom behaviour.The url is always set, it's just defaulting to ""github.com"" :wink:It's actually important to distinguish between dotcom and non-dotcom github servers, because authentication differs for those,the UI may be different depending on which one is it, and if it's neither, UI must be hidden in my case, so I need to know that as well. This is why I'm suggesting having a server identification method that tells me what type of server it is, rather than something that's enterprise-specific.",,,,,,
194572624,1097,Issue,I like that approach.,,,,,,
194574158,1097,Issue,"One thought that just occurred to me. The reason why it's an ""Enterprise Probe"" today is that there's no need to probe if the base URL is ""github.com"" or ""api.github.com"". We can just assume it's GitHub.com the website and not something else.However, I could imagine someone wanting to probe for capabilities in the future, in which this API could be the starting point for that.",,,,,,
194589057,1097,Issue,"However, I could imagine someone wanting to probe for capabilities in the future, in which this API could be the starting point for that.Yeah, I actually already do something like that for wikis, and it would be nice if instead of manually firing probes I could just ask for capabilities from the API.",,,,,,
194617537,1097,Issue,"I like the idea of making this more like a `GetCapabilities` client/request.Also, this may be a dumb question but what if someone has a hostfile entry or DNS alias to point ""external.github"" at ""github.com"".  To me it seems like rather than assume that ""only"" github.com is ""DotCom"" you sort of want to probe/confirm even ""DotCom"" capability, rather than going only off the URL?",,,,,,
195470748,1097,Issue,"If the url isn't ""github.com"", then we poke it to see whether it is a github instance, and if it is, we classify it as an enterprise instance. In your scenario this would be a false positive (or negative?), but in practice it doesn't change much, clients will still know that the server is a github instance that they can interact with.Distinguishing between a github.com and a github enterprise instance is not enough to tell a client what the server can actually do - the only important bit of information they can get out of it is whether the server is a github server or not. The only reason we're actually distinguishing between github.com and an enterprise instance is because we know that enterprise instances can potentially support only a subset of authentication types if they're older, so we're using the url as a shortcut to only run the fallback code if it's a github server but it's not github.com (which we know supports all the things).Again, in your scenario, if the url is aliased, a client would fallback to handling the server more carefully, so it's not a big deal if there's a false positive because of that.Concrete server capabilities checks I think should probably be done in separate calls, since all of these things require poking the server and aren't always needed by a client. In this way, we end up with a ""Is this a server we can talk to?"" call and ""Ah, it is! So I want to use this feature, is it available?"" calls.",,,,,,

178855101,1082,Issue,I added a working example of the search api in my sample:,,,,,,
178856364,1082,Issue,can we capture this as a failing integration test in the repo?,,,,,,
178861978,1082,Issue,yep sure.So I just need to write a failing test for:For example the below would be a valid failing integration test?,,,,,,
178864372,1082,Issue,"that seems good enough for me - and if you could mark the test as `[Fact (Skip=""see  for investigating this failing test"")]` this will help link back to this discussion",,,,,,
178869302,1082,Issue,done.,,,,,,
194719591,1082,Issue,"To do the above I removed ""All"" from the ItemState enum.And regarding the failing integration tests, by simply removing the query for ItemState.All .Also from the IssueClientTests.cs  and the build succeeded.Does this do the needful ?",,,,,,
194720064,1082,Issue,How then would someone search for **all** issues?,,,,,,
194720477,1082,Issue,"-Zuber ""All"" isn't supported by the github API.It is only a filter.To search for it you need not have to mention any ItemState.",,,,,,
194720798,1082,Issue,Sounds great.Open a Pull Request?,,,,,,
194734796,1082,Issue,"Have to be a bit careful here because `ItemState` enumeration is used in many places (Milestones, Events, Pull Requests, Issues, and more) and sometimes `all` is a vaild option and sometimes not?Eg `SearchIssueRequest` (only `open` and `closed` are allowed) vs `IssueRequest` (where `open` `closed` and `all`) are allowedSo I dont think removing All from the enum is good.  Perhaps a new enum is needed and those places where only open/closed state is allowed, are changed to the new enum?",,,,,,
194739392,1082,Issue,-Zuber  What should be done here ?,,,,,,
194745083,1082,Issue,"Thank you for pointing that out. My suggestion would be to- Create a new enum `ExpandedItemState` (or the like,   might have a better name)- Find all the places the `ItemState` enumeration is used, and check the corresponding [api docs]  - Where `All` is a valid option, use the new enum.",,,,,,
194745571,1082,Issue,#NAME?,,,,,,
194745877,1082,Issue,"So I dont think removing All from the enum is good.Also, we should be marking things as `[Obsolete]` before removing them. Because we're nice like that.",,,,,,
194746595,1082,Issue,"I like where this is heading. If it were me, I'd probably introduce a new enum in the search API instead of sharing the `ItemState` enum as it doesn't support `All`.This feels like we're going to need to introduce a breaking change here as part of the new enum. But that's fine. Just a heads up.",,,,,,
194746916,1082,Issue,I will look into as to where all the changes are to made and then get back here.,,,,,,
194749316,1082,Issue,"I like where this is heading. If it were me, I'd probably introduce a new enum in the search API instead of sharing the ItemState enum as it doesn't support All.So the opposite of what I suggested, which does make more sense as it is much less of a change :)",,,,,,
194769781,1082,Issue,Or alternatively on the line: We can simply change the code from:toor something along those lines... just a far simpler change IMHO. Maybe add a link to the api/issue to explain if needs be.,,,,,,
194803162,1082,Issue,"that won't do much good because then we need to check if ""All"" state exists for that particular parameter or not and there are a lot of parameters.",,,,,,
194846945,1082,Issue,"yeah, its preferable to not show an option (ie an `All` entry in Enum) to a user when it doesn't actually exist in the GitHub API like that.  I'd make a new enum called `SearchItemState` or `ItemStateSimple` or something like that, and use that on the Search functions (and anywhere else that might be limited to only open/closed).  I'd also update the XmlDoc comments on the `ItemStateSimple? State` parameter of `SearchIssueRequest` to note that leaving it unspecified will enact the GitHub default",,,,,,
194855113,1082,Issue,"State.All _does_ exist... just implicitly e.g.The result above returns both _open_ and _closed_ issues. Hence my suggestion - remove the param from being added on the condition `State != ItemState.All` Regardless of which way this is implemented - the search issues needs to give back:1. open issues2. closed issues3. open and closed issuesIf there are any other areas of the code where `ItemState.All` is relevant, append it to the parameters. If not - do not add it, we just need to ensure the expected results match the GitHub api.-EDIT-Unless passing in null refers to search both open and closed issues...? Then yeah - we should create a new enum as suggested.",,,,,,
195005146,1082,Issue,I have created the new enum by the name ItemStateFilterAnd read the docs and made changes everywhere as said by -Zuber Also made the corresponding changes in the unit as well as integration tests.The build was successful [link]My forked repository is [here],,,,,,

Where should the test be moved to?Thanks!",,,,,,
242902955,1081,Issue,"Hi  As far as I can gather, in order to test the LinqPad samples the proposal is that during the build, we rewrite the linqpad files to use local reference to the octokit DLLs (ie those that were just built) instead of pulling nuget packages (which dont contain the very latest changes in the build) then execute them to ensure they dont have any errors.   even ended up writing an example in c# I didn't really understand why that test should be ported to F#The octokit.net build system is currently using FAKE, which I assume means we need that ""rewrite linqpad files to contain local references and execute them"" code to be in F# as a native task in the build.

We've submitted some patches upstream to `SimpleJson.cs`, but `SimpleJsonSerializer` is the hooks for us to control how to serialize and deserialize objects in the context of Octokit.For me, I guess it comes down to whether you're happy with how you're using the current Octokit APIs, or whether there's a different way (or abstraction?) you'd like to use. Then we could talk about extracting the models and serialization logic - I gather that's the bit you're really interested in here, rather than just the JSON pieces.One such scenario that I need to flesh out is consuming webhooks - I'd want to reuse the models (and thus the deserialization rules) we already have, but how they plug into an MVC app is very different. as an aside - why would anyone need/use yet another json parser?

I forget the product, it came through via Twitter.The serializer rules are kind of tweaked to what the GitHub API expects - but it's nothing special.Here's a bit of a brain dump of some of the more quirky features on offer beyond that: - with request models, `null` values are not sent by default- you opt into those with a `[SerializeNull]` attribute- managing the formatting of properties when serializing/deserializing - server expects Ruby style (like `review_comment_url`) and client expects .NET style (like `ReviewCommentUrl`)- a few different ways to override this when deserializing - e.g. enum serialization, map JSON property to different response- converting text to base64 when sending is done through `[SerializeAsBase64]` so the user doesn't care about the implementation detailsI'm :thumbsup: if someone wants to extract these relevant bits and explore making it more general purpose for API clients.",,,,,,

173431921,1062,Issue,"-Zuber So NSubstitute takes a different tact to other mocking frameworks by making the proxy object transparent (no `Mock` anywhere), and using extension methods on the object to verify behaviour. This is the purpose of the `.Received()` extension method, but it's a bit obscure because it still returns your `IApiConnection`.So from the value returned from `.Receieved()` you then declare the method you expected to be invoked - using the `Arg` helper class to do expression-based checks of the arguments provided during the test. Without the null on the last line the test will fail on an `Ensure` check that the uri is null, but it is not clear why it is needed or what it does.I gather this is occurring due to the overloads on `Get` but it's hard to say specifically without a bit more context. So it sounds like the `Get(Uri uri)` code was failing the test, but `Get parameters)` was making the test pass - does that sound right to you?Also, if an `Ensure` check isn't occurring I suspect some actual code is being invoked. Do you recall where that was?Happy to run up the tests myself in #1061 if there's a specific way to trigger what you're seeing.",,,,,,

Let me know what you think!FYI I still need to run the integration tests against our enterprise instance at work tomorrow, so DONT MERGE just yet!  I'll advise once integration tests are complete.  Given we are going to be adding more Enterprise API calls to Octokit.net, we need to think about whether we can get access to a GitHub Enterprise instance from the automated builds so they can cover off the Enterprise Integration Tests.   ?On previously merged PR's I had added a `[GitHubEnterpriseTest]` test attribute, so the tests are only detected when the `OCTOKIT_GITHUBENTERPRISEURL` environment variable is present, but specifying that also then uses that enterprise instance for the normal integration tests and there's no specific GHE environment vars for user/password/token etc either.  If there is desire to get GitHub Enterprise integration tests as part of the automated process (considering we are planning on adding coverage for all the enterprise endpoints, I think this would be a good idea!) then I will do some more work in another PR to create explicit integration helper class for dealing with GHE including all the required stuff (user, password, token, organization etc etc).",,,,,,

195107680,1000,Issue,"This is what I found. I was about to open a PR when I spotted the without fingerprint in the documentation. The code for CanCreateAndGetAuthorizationWithoutFingerprint and CanCreateAndGetAuthorizationByFingerprint is almost the same. In without fingerprint when creating authorization, it checked for tokenlasteight and hashedtoken values too. But it doesn't do so in  with fingerprint. By reading the comments it seems like it was assumed these were returned only when they were requested the second time(which is not so according to the documentation) and not when they were created.Also I had removed the newauthorizations overloaded constructor without the fingerprint parameter(as now it was a required thing), but it was being used at multiple places, like creating personal tokens etc, so I kept it.In the documentation, in the Deprecation Notice it says that ""token is still supported"" in both Get-or-create an authorization for a specific app' and 'Get-or-create an authorization for a specific app and fingerprint'. So does this mean that they'll remove this is future?

So when doing CI builds ideally you want to build the ""merge"" one and not the ""head"" one, since it doesnt really matter if the PR itself builds, what we care about is whether master builds once the PR is mergedBut if you are using the commit status API to set build status on the PR/commits, then when the status is pushed, that changes the commit hash on the /merge branch which then fires off another build etc.  Unfortunately we havent figured out a neat way of dealing with this as yet so we are stuck building /head of PR's when we really want to be building /mergeIs this similar to the ""multiple builds"" issue you are referring to with octokit and appveyor?  If there are any solutions Id be all ears.  One thing is we could send the webhooks to an intermediary service that would analyze the github/PR etc and then figure out whether it was only a commit status update or a ""real change"" and only relay the build to TeamCity if it was a ""real change"".  But that's getting pretty nasty :)",,,,,,
164311186,999,Issue,"yeah, I'm not _too_ fussed about it, but I do like verifying the branch tip as well as the merge commit. But yes, it's exactly the same issue - here's how AppVeyor displays it:",,,,,,
164311206,999,Issue,Interesting. I think there are two potential ideal solutions.1. If GitHub gave more granularity in Webhooks when sending pushes to build. You could contact  and suggest that.2. If AppVeyor gave us more options to control which branch of a pull request gets built. This is similar to your intermediary service suggestion.  is pretty responsive and might be willing to consider that change. :smile:,,,,,,
164343298,999,Issue,"You see two builds if both feature branch and PR are in the same repo. With forked repos this works nice as you get PR build only in the master repo.Regarding commit status - to set PR status the status should be set on branch commit, not a virtual ""merge"" commit - at least AppVeyor does that right now, last time I tried setting status on merge commit it didn't change PR status.I don't know yet what would be the best strategy to implement prevention of branch commit build if that commit participates in PR(s). When you do a push to feature branch, usually ""push"" event comes first (guaranteed?), then ""sync"" events for all affected PRs. How do we know that commit is part of PR(s), not a regular ""working"" commit? Check [all commits of all PRs]? This could be slow.",,,,,,

That scenario probably favours calling `HttpClientFactory` internally, like we did before.On the other, if you're wanting to tweak some settings (proxy, timeout, or even some extensibility that the `HttpMessageHandler` pattern supports) then you're probably going to be happy with doing the setup yourself - or perhaps bringing your own `HttpClient` implementation.",,,,,,

Alas, no `GitHubClient` ctor accepts an `HttpClient` as a parameter.Implementing `IConnection` looks *much* more laborious than implementing `HttpMessageHandler` because it has dozens of members instead of just one. And mocking up `IGitHubClient` assumes that I know how `GitHubClient` is *supposed* to work, but I don't. My tests should include executing actual `GitHubClient` code (and github.com server code, the first time) so that I verify I'm using the class correctly. If I mock up `IGitHubClient` then I can make it behave how I *think* it should behave rather than testing my code with how it *actually* behaves.My strategy with other server-connected SDKs has been to inject my own `HttpMessageHandler` that *records* the operations the first time (while I'm writing the tests).

This is interesting but what you're interested about in this massive page is called the [**Numerical Sandbox Limits**]. Everything in there is basically moot except one. Connections. It's limited at 300 per server on which it runs on. Azure Functions initially starts with one server executing all of your functions. Then it starts to scale up to 2, 3, N servers. Each of those ""servers"" have that 300 limit.If you are creating a new `HttpClient` every time a request is made, [you end up running out of sockets] as Windows waits 240 seconds to completely close the socket. That means that if I'm limited to a theoritical limit of 300 Octokit requests per servers per 4 minutes which translates to 1.25 requests per seconds. If I exceed that, I break the limit of the sandbox.This literally makes Octokit unusable for Azure Functions on a consumption plan. This led me to go bare metal and use something like this: This allows me better control over the `HttpClient` and will allow me to survive the Connection sandbox limits.If you have any questions, please fire away.",,,,,,
413228795,984,Issue,"How is that different? You're still creating a new `HttpClient`, right?",,,,,,
413230532,984,Issue,I store it as static on my class.,,,,,,
413231380,984,Issue,And what's the reason you can't do the same with `GitHubClient`?,,,,,,
413232591,984,Issue,"From discussions with , it creates an HttpClient per request and is not saved statically or reused. Can we confirm?",,,,,,
413235191,984,Issue,"No, it creates a `HttpClient` per `GitHubClient` instance. This is the code path when creating a `GitHubClient`:And this actually sends the request:As you can see; only one instance. Did you actually get into problems with connection limits, or did you just assume that you would?",,,,,,
413256186,984,Issue,"As you can see; only one instance.Oh cool, I legit thought something else was happening underneath. I thought  was scolding me about this at some stage but I can't find an issue about it. That means that if I'm limited to a theoritical limit of 300 Octokit requests per servers per 4 minutes which translates to 1.25 requests per seconds.Keep in mind that Octokit will follow pagination links if a request has more results, so if you are using a `GetAll` API and the repository is non-trivial in terms of activity it's not a 1-1 mapping of request/response here.  If I exceed that, I break the limit of the sandbox.What does ""break"" here entail? And how might we glean what the source of that ""break"" might be?",,,,,,
413270814,984,Issue,"Even if new `HttpClient` instances were created for each request, that shouldn't mean new connections for each one. `HttpClient` is just a glorified front for older networking APIs in .NET that are already smart enough to reuse connections across multiple requests (if KeepAlive is set to true, anyway, IIRC).",,,,,,
413277702,984,Issue,"Even if new `HttpClient` instances were created for each request, that shouldn't mean new connections for each one.I think that's exactly what it means, which is why [it's advised against]: `HttpClient` is intended to be instantiated once and reused throughout the life of an application. The following conditions can result in `SocketException` errors: - Creating a new `HttpClient` instance per request. - Server under heavy load. Creating a new `HttpClient` instance per request can exhaust the available sockets.Related info:A static instance [can also be problematic], which is why ASP.NET Core 2.1 introduced [HttpClientFactory]. There's also an ongoing issue about it [in corefx].",,,,,,
413293406,984,Issue,"I did get into issues. I had both errors from the sandbox itself and actual ""permission exception"" from the TCP stack rejecting new sockets opening.That being confirmed, I'll check if there are other places where things might crash.",,,,,,
413358421,984,Issue,"Were you using any IOC containers or anything that might cause multiple `GitHubClient` instances to be declared?Generally whenever these types of things comes up around `HttpClient`, it does seem to be mostly solvable using the existing options provided in Octokit, and it is more just a lack of discoverability/documentation causing users to be unaware of them.  The override on `Connection` that lets you specify an `IHttpClient` implementation means you could roll your own (admittedly a bit onerous given the number of methods to implement) or you can use the Octokit implementation of this interface (`HttpClientAdapter`) which lets you specify your own `HttpMessageHandler`.In terms of Octokit's Http extensibility, I wonder if now .NET Core has the [new `HttpClientFactory`] stuff, we should consider reworking Octokit to use this (and allow the user to pass in their own)?",,,,,,
414427588,984,Issue,I don't think Octokit was the issue. I think it might be due internally in how Durable Functions works.I have a workaround in place. I've already talked to the team to make sure we don't need a workaround. So either increasing limits of the sandbox or changing the Durable Functions defaults.Let's see what they do.,,,,,,
162802836,983,Issue,"Had a look at this and found it to be a larger yak than previously anticipated. Problems to address:- `lprun` doesn't have an easy way to install certain packages - it's probably using `%APPDATA%\NuGet\NuGet.Config`- `nuget.exe` has a way to manage these sources from the CLI so we could script it, but perhaps we're not allowed to do this on AppVeyor. I gather this will be the same thing for TravisCI.- if we can do this, we should clean up after it done- what about if the build fails - does FAKE have a good way to run cleanup scripts?",,,,,,
163059783,983,Issue,I am going to fix the specific example to get it working and open another issue to address this for every check-in.,,,,,,
163064645,983,Issue,:thumbsup:,,,,,,
165617770,983,Issue,"A thought based on re-reading [the docs] just now: LINQPad also supports the ref directive for referencing additional assemblies. You can specify the assembly either via its filename (including the directory if it's outside the .NET Framework) or its fully qualified name (if it's in the GAC): For the purposes of CI, could we reference local packages (and the just-compiled assemblies) - rather than fighting with all the conventions of NuGet packaging?It could work like this:- take the file from version control and read it into memory: - replace the XML element with a new payload referencing local files:- pass this new file to `lprun.exe` and verify the current code works",,,,,,

162415174,975,Issue,Looking good so far ! A couple of things I'd like to verify as part of integration tests:- that we're able to deserialize a release correctly using this endpoint- what happens when no releases exist for a repository?,,,,,,
162421134,975,Issue,"I have added tests. This one is similar to GetRelease API. Just replaced release id with ""latest"".  In the tests for getrelease we are only checking if we can receive the get request at that endpoint and throw proper exceptions when missing arguments. If there is no latest release, are we expected to get a Null JSON or we a  500 error?",,,,,,
162422472,975,Issue,"we have some existing tests which use the real GitHub API - let's add a couple of tests for this endpoint there: A couple of tests I think we can do to complete this feature:- ""get the latest release for Octokit"" - we get a non-null `Release` back- ""get the latest release for a new repository"" -> get a helpful error back  If there is no latest release, are we expected to get a Null JSON or we a 500 error?I'm honestly not sure - let's find out by writing the test!I think the end result should be a custom exception that we throw to the user. There's a detailed example [here] for how we handle when creating a repository fails - I think you'll have to do something similar and `try-catch` the call and then check if the error is something we're familiar with.",,,,,,

I should have made my reservations about adding another `ctor` parameter clearer, as I'd been trying to think of a better solution to this problem but was sidetracked as usual.I'm not enthusiastic about adding in yet another `ctor` parameter to `GitHubClient` - mostly due to the current complexity of how timeouts work with the HTTP stack, which you've called out elsewhere. The other concern I have here is about supporting this long-term - at some point I'd love to support a smaller set of `ctors` on `GitHubClient`, but that's a debate that has yet to happen so I'm just speaking for myself right now.So, while I feel awful for closing this PR, I'm trying to make amends by opening a discussion about making the whole HTTP stack more friendly to Octokit consumers #984. I've also opened the first PR which takes us down that path #985 so we can talk about tangible things. I'd love your feedback on either (or both!) topic, as I don't think there's as much work involved as I previously expected - we just need to sit down and work through it...",,,,,,

158578997,963,Issue,"The reason for the `TaskCanceledExceptions` is because the  default [HttpClient] `Timeout` is 100 seconds. I tried changing in the sample from `Nullable()`  to `new TimeSpan(0, 10, 0)` to see if that would fix. But the [HttpClientAdapter] that is implemented does not set the timeout passed in the request to the `HttpClient`. The `Timeout` is being used only used in the `CancellationTokenSource` ~~This is a bug. The `Timeout` property should set to the `TimeSpan` set in the Request.~~I'll do a PR for this. By the time if you want a workaround you could have a `HttpClient` class that implements `IHttpClient` and pass that to the `Connection` class like this.",,,,,,

162709655,963,Issue,If I am not wrong the timeout is only for that request which is cancellation token. But http would time out all the request when it reaches 100 seconds (v=vs.100).aspx .   is using the same http client with multiple simultaneous concurrent requests.,,,,,,

I kind of wanted to avoid having to put my personal access token into config/setting an environment variable/prompting for a password whilst I'm spiking this and I'm also switching machines as I travel around.Anyway, the ROI on taking this further is not worth it. If this spike ever becomes a thing then it will end up as a windows service somewhere and we already have a general solution for storing credentials in that scenario.Thanks for the answers!",,,,,,

Relevant update:---From poking around the code it looks like adding a new property to the CreateFileRequest object (CreateFileRequest.cs), that mapped to the appropriate encoding parameter (or a prop called ""IsBinary"" that would serialize properly), would do the trick.

140561319,894,Issue,The reason for the failure is because the release api has an optional argument called `label` along with `name` which is requiredThe releaseclient code `UploadAsset` method  invokes the `ExpandUriTemplate` method  which does not expand the `name` parameter for the api which is required because it expects only one parameter which is the bug. ![bug]This is causing the api throw an error with `Invalid name for request` because request `name` was not provided in the call.

Refs can be namespaced, e.g: `shiftkey/my-cool-feature` - and as edge-case as it might be, `prcreator-testing/branch-to-merge` could also be a valid ref. Without hitting the API, we can't verify it.Perhaps a better error message here (it's pretty easy to test this against the real API) with a reference to the docs page for creating a PR to help diagnose?I don't want to make this area too clever, but I empathise with the lack of docs in general.",,,,,,
138252139,880,Issue,"I think at minimum emphasising the format of the base and head refs in the docs is good enough. In particular, the base ref doesn't include the username, but the head ref does (I havent checked what happens if you specify the username in the base ref too, maybe it works?)Am I right in saying that the GitHub API could return a more helpful error message here, if the branch doesn't exist, because its returning 3 confusing error messages simply because the caller is specifying an invalid branch? It says ""base sha"" and ""head sha"" empty or not specified, and ""No commits between [the specified branches]"". If this is the case then perhaps this is an issue for the main github API, but it would super awesome if Octokit could fix up the error message but perhaps ""nice to have"".",,,,,,

I've opened a separate issue to clarify the docs to prevent anyone else struggling for hours with the same thing.Correct.

If I understand correctly, you want to **create** a personal access token with a specific scope using Octokit.That is possible using the [authorizations API].In Octokit, you'd do something like this:That creates an authorization with the scope that... Grants read/write access to code, commit statuses, collaborators, and deployment statuses for public repositories and organizations. Also required for starring public repositories.The list of scopes is located here: I don't see one that limits scope to just viewing pull requests.",,,,,,
128545829,859,Issue,"Ah, I misunderstood too! So the code I showed creates an Application Authorization. It's an OAuth token that authorizes an application to perform actions. You can see these listed here: If you require a Personal Access Token (listed here ) then you'll need to go through the [Web Flow] as  mentioned.Since that flow is an OAuth token exchange workflow, there's really not a good way for Octokit to just handle it for you.We could probably implement some libraries for WPF apps to initiate the web flow at some point. I think that'd be a nice to have and would at least make this much simpler for people to implement.",,,,,,
128550947,859,Issue,"honestly, I'm looking to do this with client-side automation so these would be in a command-line or powershell environment. I'd have access to interactive sessions however, so I suppose WPF would be acceptable. I think the biggest hurdle will be 2fa.Right now I'm looking at hitting , catching a failure, look at the header for 2fa failure codes, and then asking for the 2fa bit. In theory, with that - I should be able to acquire a token, store it, and reuse it as needed.Sounds about right?",,,,,,
128763919,859,Issue,"honestly, I'm looking to do this with client-side automation so these would be in a command-line or powershell environment.Oh, in that case why would you need to create an access token? After all, you have a chicken and egg problem here. Your script, in order to create a token, would need some credentials to have the authorization to create the token.So instead of giving your script a username and password, manually create an authorization token once, and give that to your script.Perhaps I'm missing something. Right now I'm looking at hitting , catching a failure, look at the header for 2fa failure codes, and then asking for the 2fa bit. In theory, with that - I should be able to acquire a token, store it, and reuse it as needed.Yep, that's about right.In `Octokit.Reactive` we have a `GetOrCreateApplicationAuthentication` method that handles part of this flow for you. You can pass in a `Func` that gets called if the initial request fails because of a 2fa error.We don't have a `Task` based version yet, but I'd love to add one at some point. That code was pretty much pulled from GitHub for Windows which is all Rx based.",,,,,,
127158474,858,Issue,"You should be fine using the regular `Octokit` package as well, the `Octokit.Reactive` package just wraps the former with `IObservable`, which will return the _last_ result. See [Rx and Await: Some Notes].If you really want to use the reactive API, you should correctly subscribe to the observable, using the `Subscribe` method. Its callback argument will be called for each `GitHubCommit` in the repository.",,,,,,
127164105,858,Issue,Thanks for this fast and good answer!Looks like I'm a complete idiot - I have no idea how I could miss that the `GetAll` method is also available within the `Octokit` project and not only in `Octokit.Reactive`.... (I was so sure it isn't...)Didn't know that part about Rx and Await  - so at least I learned something while making a fool of myself.Anyway thanks again - I'll close this.,,,,,,
126891620,857,Issue,Looks good to me!![thumbs-up-steve],,,,,,
126805703,856,Issue,"Rather than accepting a null value, I wonder if we should have a special value. For example, we could have a static `ApiConnection.EmptyBody` property that's just an empty `object` and use that for cases when you're supposed to pass in an empty body. I try and avoid overloading `null` like this because it's hard to determine if you passed `null` as a mistake or intentionally.Also, what happens if you just pass in `new object()` right now as the `data` argument. Does that do the right thing today?",,,,,,
126867178,856,Issue,tried your suggestion of an Empty static instead of `null`; moved it to it's own class to avoid coupling `Connection` to depend on `ApiConnection` while `ApiConnection` depends on `IConnection`.Take a look. All tests pass. Ran `.\build FixProjects` to add `ResponseBody.cs` to all projects. And it fixed my use case. :+1:,,,,,,

126966532,855,Issue,"-Folder I'd suggest a couple of calls:- `ETag` can be found by creating a new repository - that should be easy enough- `Links` are a bit trickier (because most of our existing APIs are going to follow them as part of pagination). You might be able to check for the last value after the pagination is done - so something like ""list your repos"" might work for you.- `X-OAuth-Scopes` and `X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes` require the caller to be configured with token authentication - that depends on the `OCTOKIT_OAUTHTOKEN` environment variable being set, but the caller might not have this setup.",,,,,,

(These are the redirect codes actively used by the GitHub API.) - **MUST** redirect a 30x status code if the HTTP method is HEAD, OPTIONS, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE. - **MUST** use the original request's HTTP method when following a redirect where the HTTP status code is 307. - **SHOULD** use the original request's HTTP method when following a redirect where the HTTP status code is 301 or 302. - **MUST** use the original request's authentication credentials when following a redirect where the original host matches the redirect host. - **MUST NOT** use the original request's authentication credentials when following a redirect where the original host does not match the redirect host. - **SHOULD** only follow 3 redirects.Does that help?",,,,,,

78279093,749,Issue,"Also, has anyone else reported issues getting the tests to show up in Visual Studio (I'm using VS 2013 Pro Update 4)? My Test Explorer is empty and I've attempted to clear the cache as recommended at  without success. It would be easier to troubleshoot the issues I'm having with the integration tests if I could run them in isolation from VS and/or debug them without having to use the build script each time. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with FAKE, F#, or xUnit to figure out from the FAKE script what commands to run from the prompt.",,,,,,

Just getting frustrated that it's taking me several hours to set up the build and test environment for what is probably going to be a five minute fix. I'll keep pounding away and try not to spam the issue any more than I have to until I get everything ready for patching.",,,,,,
78303004,749,Issue,"So I know I promised I'd keep the comments to a minimum, but this is just too strange.First, I could not get the Visual Studio xUnit runner to work for the life of me. I played around with it some more and finally got it to consistently hang on discovering tests in `Octokit.Tests.Integration.dll`:Can't get past that point though so, okay, no VS test runner. Figured out how to run from the command line:The problem is, the test kept failing on different lines. Sometimes it would be the first assertion, sometimes the second, etc. That led me to think it might be a timing problem. I finally got it to consistently succeed by changing the test code (notice the `Thread.Sleep()` calls in-between each API invocation):It looks like it's got to be a fairly long time too - 4 or 6 seconds wouldn't pass consistently. So that got _this_ test passing, but all the other integration tests are a mess on my system. Most fail at arbitrary assertion points that seem to change from one run to the next. That probably just suggests more timing problems, but it does make it hard/impossible to run the entire test suite.So that's where I'm at, _but here's the really, really strange thing_ - when the `CanStarAndUnstarAGist()` test failed part way through, this is what I saw in the GitHub UI:I waited for a solid 5 minutes thinking it might be some sort of eventual consistency problem, but it never changed. I also tried looking at it in a different browser in case there was some sort of browser caching going on, but it was the same. Once I got the test to pass using the sleep calls, it started acting normally again.![]So anyway, I've had about as much of this as I can take for a day. I'll come back tomorrow and attempt a test case and WIP PR for starring repos, though at this point it wouldn't surprise me if the issue I initially saw was somehow related to all these other timing problems and isolated to my own environment.",,,,,,
78308763,749,Issue,Is there some sort of server-side cache? Cache invalidation is Really Hard™,,,,,,
78318277,749,Issue,"Okay, okay, I know I said I'd wait until tomorrow - so sue me.I wrote a test, and that unexpectedly worked without any additional modifications (with `Thread.Sleep()` calls) but I still couldn't get my little test case to work. In fact, attempting to star from the same user account and same repository in the test and then in LINQPad produced different results until I noticed one difference: the integration tests authenticate with username and password while the LINQPad test I was doing authenticated with a token.This works (`result == true` and repository gets starred):This does not work (`result == false`, but no exception, and repository does not get starred):I know the token is valid because I can do other things with it like list all the repositories starred by that user.This throws a `AuthorizationException` (I just changed one character in the token):So I'm thinking maybe at this point I don't fully understand the GitHub starring API. Sure enough, after a little more digging with additional personal tokens, I learned that starring a repository requires the `public_repo` OAuth scope and not the `user` scope - which doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me since `user` lets you view stars and it seems like starring should be a user-focused activity, but whatever.Problem solved. Congrats - I'm an idiot and there's nothing wrong with Octokit! (Though I'll add that the odd behavior of the UI after starring through the API is still really strange)",,,,,,
78368684,749,Issue,"Woah, lots of words here. Sorry to hear about all this pain you're going through just to run my tests :cry: I guess that makes this an xUnit problem, so I'll see if I can follow up there.Hold off on raising this until I've upgraded to xUnit 2.0 RC4 in #725 - I've encountered a similar issue in the past which was subsequently fixed by the team.

It won't return you all the authorizations, but for specific cases it should be a good enough workaround.I've written a test here which demonstrates this behaviour: is there any way to using GitHub API with Personal access tokens. or taking token with basic authorization?I'm not sure I understand the question.

78006353,744,Issue,"thanks for the feedback! When I saw the tweet earlier today I was really excited to see what was on the way! However, one of the things I found a little frustrating was that there doesn't seem to be any options for timing out an Octokit call - some of the _gitHubClient.Activity.Starring.GetAllForUser(starrer) calls we make take an exceptionally long time to return. Yeah, this is something I've been putting off and pushing out for a while.Here's a TL:DR on the situation as it stands:- the API support pagination using the [Link] header whenever sets of results are returned- Octokit will auto-follow the pagination results until it's reached the end of the set- the end user will get the entire result setAnd this sucks for anything involved with wanting to control the # of pages returned or cancel an in-flight request. And in some cases the calls never get completed and silently fail.If you can recreate this (quite often it's related to a specific user account) I'd love to investigate this further. Could very well be an issue with how we're using the SDK, but regardless I'd like to have the option to time out individual requests.Yep, there's a couple of options at hand - and making it all work in an uncomplicated way is something I'll need to start working on Real Soon. With Rx, disposing the subscription is generally considered The Right Way to do that, so I'm not really worried about that scenario right now.A couple of ideas (one or the other or both could land in the framework):- the pagination work in #740 would help you constrain how much data you want. The initial feedback I've got on this seems promising, but it's a big change to everything so I don't want to rush it.- `HttpClient` supports providing a `CancellationToken` when it's making a request - perhaps we should have overloads on the `GetAll` operation so that you can cancel the in-flight requests (this should also kill the pagination, but I need to confirm this). This feels better than reinventing the wheel.I'd love to hear more about your scenario (is pagination better than cancellation?) so I can focus things in the short-term. I see that in #587 you added the ability to set a default timeout across the entire connection - glad I know about it now but it's not obvious or easy to find :pThat would work for a single request - we added this because uploading release assets takes a while - but for our scenario where we reset the timer for each request (due to pagination) it probably won't be enforced.",,,,,,
78142636,744,Issue,"HttpClient supports providing a CancellationToken when it's making a request - perhaps we should have overloads on the GetAll operation so that you can cancel the in-flight requests (this should also kill the pagination, but I need to confirm this). This feels better than reinventing the wheel.This is my preference - feels idiomatic :) If you can recreate this (quite often it's related to a specific user account) I'd love to investigate this further.That's what it looks like - I didn't dig in with something like Fiddler to see what was happening at the HTTP level but we weren't receiving any rate limit exceptions or anything like that. If I had to guess, these long-running queries were for users who had starred a large number of repositories. The ""Robert Scoble"" effect for Github :p In our scenario cancellation is the preferred way of doing it - being able to mark N number of requests as failed and return partial results from the operations that were successful is what's most appropriate in our specific scenario, although it's worth noting that our scenario is for educational purposes only :p   thanks for the feedback! When I saw the tweet earlier today I was really excited to see what was on the way!We announced it to our attendees (who've done the previous two units over the past couple of weeks) this morning - seems like a hit so far:",,,,,,
89975589,744,Issue,I'm feeling that #760 is a more familiar option for developers than cancellation tokens (and more useful in general):Once that lands on `master` I'll close this out.Let me know if you have any other thoughts on either approach.,,,,,,

78246446,740,Issue,"Went back and forth with  about this API stuff, and he pointed out that this change will make the task returned from `DeferredRequest` cold. And that's going against the [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern] book which recommends starting the task as early as possible. ""All tasks returned from TAP methods must be “hot.” **If a TAP method internally uses a Task’s constructor to instantiate the task to be returned, the TAP method must call Start on the Task object prior to returning it.** Consumers of a TAP method may safely assume that the returned task is “hot,” and should not attempt to call Start on any Task returned from a TAP method. Calling Start on a “hot” task will result in an InvalidOperationException (this check is handled automatically by the Task class).""I don't think this is impossible to do within our current infrastructure, but right now I need to be mindful of this.",,,,,,

72234350,689,Issue,Could you post the request and response from a Fiddler trace (with private details ommitted of course) in here?,,,,,,
72236218,689,Issue,I haven't used that before but I'll figure it out shortly. In the meantime I can tell you that I have tried this several times with multiple organizations and have not received any emails from github. After searching through the octokit code I found this function in Helpers/ApiUrls:which uses the deprecated api endpoint and is used in this function inside /Clients/TeamClients:. So we can start from there while I figure out how to use Fiddler trace.,,,,,,
72236845,689,Issue,"Ah! That's almost certainly it. If you clone the repo, apply that fix, and try it out, it'll probably work.Would you be interested in fixing it and submitting a pull request? If you need help with that process, I'm happy to help. :smile:",,,,,,
72237417,689,Issue,I would be very interested in fixing it however I would need a bit of assistance on that part. I have only been using GIT for about 2 weeks but it's very interesting and I've always found helpful code here. I'll start by cloning and seeing if I can get it to work for me. Then I'll ask about the pull request process once I'm ready. I appreciate the quick replies!,,,,,,
72255470,689,Issue,"So I've got the project cloned locally and the fix is done but I'm a bit stuck on the testing part. I'm a little unclear on how to generate the DLL so I can use it in my main project, unless there's a better way to test.EDIT: and also I believe the response from the new endpoint is slightly different than the old so more changes will be needed than simply modifying the endpoint",,,,,,
72340038,689,Issue,"probably the easiest way to test with your app is to compile your app, then replace the Octokit.dll with the patched version and then run your app.",,,,,,
72472094,689,Issue,I must have been having a friday afternoon brain fart cause I got it working first thing this morning. So I've made the change to the TeamMember function but I left the TeamMembers function the same because that endpoint seems to still be current. I have the windows GIT client now so I'll attempt to commit to master and I think that's all I'll have to do. If there's anything I should know about pull requests in general just let me know!,,,,,,
72493281,689,Issue,"in general, it's best not to commit to `master`. Create a branch for your work and commit it there. The reason for this is if there are new changes to `master` upstream (aka new changes to `master` in `octokit/octokit.net`), it's easier to update `master` on your fork with those changes from upstream and then either merge them into your branch or rebase your branch against them.When you create a pull request, it'll do the right thing and create the pull request against the upstream `master`. Does that make sense?",,,,,,
72509746,689,Issue,"I think so, so I'll make a separate branch for myself and then make a pull request. Still new to this whole process but I think I'm getting the hang of it. Apparently I've setup my current system to only commit to the master branch. Maybe I should restructure things. Thanks for the tip!",,,,,,
72513849,689,Issue,"Cool! We're happy to help. We follow something we call [The GitHub Flow]. There's a lot of good guides if you need more background info here: And of course, the Octokit maintainers are happy to help when we can, though we get :arrow_down: :droplet: at times.",,,,,,
72514517,689,Issue,Ha I was literally just reading over GitHub Flow as I saw the email get here. I've got the Github for windows client running and I'm trying to figure out how to do a pull request on there. I made a branch but I can't figure out the UI so I'll keep reading. Thanks for the guides! I'll be reviewing them next!,,,,,,
72533814,689,Issue,So I've created a pull request and updated the test cases that I missed. Nothing really compares to actually doing a pull request for understanding how it works so thanks for the opportunity! Feeling a lot more confident in how this works now.

70425306,678,Issue,"I'm a fan of immutability too, but I think using `readonly` fields instead of properties will introduce more problems than it solves.First of all, I think we want to stick with properties. Data binding infrastructure in much of .NET depends on properties, not fields. It _might_ not make sense to bind to these objects, but I don't want to prevent it. Also, it gives us the freedom to change the implementation of the property in the future should we ever have a good reason to do so.Also, a `readonly` field currently doesn't guarantee immutability. It just so happens via a fluke of implementation that you _can_ set a `readonly` field via reflection, but as [Eric Lippert points out]... I note also that just because you can in some implementation today does not mean that you can on every implementation for all time. I am not aware of any place where we document that readonly fields must be mutable via reflection. As far as I know, a conforming implementation of the CLI is perfectly free to implement readonly fields such that they throw exceptions when mutated via reflection after the constructor is doneThe point here is while we can't rely on this behavior, it is possible today negating the immutability guarantee. Our current implementation is every bit as immutable as one with `readonly` fields.Lastly, if the implementation ever did change, it would considerably complicate our deserialization of these objects.For all these reasons, I would rather stick with the way we currently do them. Until the language supports `immutable` as a first class construct, the best we can do is provide a ""verbal"" guarantee of immutability. :smile:",,,,,,

67920431,642,Issue,"You're right. Although, while this discussion is a specific one around the `IssueEvent` and `EventInfo` objects my ultimiate goal was to determine the answer to the following: Given a request, should you have properties in the response object that are always null (unused)?If the answer is **no** then it justifies keeping `IssueEvent` and `EventInfo` seperate because even though they differ by the `Issue` field it still means that I'm not reusing a response DTO which when I make request A it populates `Issue` and when I make request B it does not.It also means that each media-type must have a seperate response object for that media-type (and thus, a seperate method call e.g. `GetCommentsHtml` vs `GetCommentsText`, etc..). Because I can't put `Body`, `BodyHtml` and `BodyText` in the `Comment` response model because given a certain media-type some of those properties will always be null. (Also, the 'full' media-type populates a `BodyHtml` and `BodyText` (and I think the regular `Body`) which  means I can't juse reuse a single `Body` field)If the answer is **yes** then it means we should be able to save ourselves different permutations of the same response model and put properties that can sometimes be unused. That would then suggest we should be able to combine `IssueEvent` and `EventInfo` since it's OK that sometimes the `Issue` property is populated and sometimes its not.The answer to this question actually solves #593.",,,,,,

67789622,638,Issue,"Figured as much.  My code actually gets jammed up (the ForbiddenException mentioned above) long before I even get to perform _any_ update operations :(  instead, it actually 100% reliably dies immediately after the first 20 calls to the API to create one each of the first 20 of the 57 issues I'm trying to add/create/insert.FWIW, my pseudo-algorithm that does the work looks generally like this ...1. read 57 records into a collection from the CSV file2. loop through the collection of records from the CSV, calling the API _once_ each for each record to create a corresponding new GitHub issue entry; if this worked, this would presumably be 57 API calls3. loop through the records in the CSV to assemble the necessary metadata for the update of each GitHub issue, calling the API once each for each GitHub issue I want to update; if this worked, this too would presumably be another 57 API callsWhen I run my code against just 10 records, all three of the above steps work just fine and I get exactly the issues and updates appearing in my test-repo on GitHub just as expected.  However, when I attempt to run all 57 records, after the first 20 records are processed in Step 2 (e.g., 20 calls to the API to create new issues) I reliably receive the ForbiddenException as mentioned. FWIW, even if my code were to get past the 57 insert/create calls in Step 3, the scope of the update I am attempting for each GitHub issue includes just the status (e.g., CLOSED) and adding a tag or two in most cases.To perform the updates, I'm using the Update method on this library's IssuesClient (see ) to perform this update and passing it a single instance of the IssueUpdate object (see ) populated with the entirety of the changes I want to apply.  My impression of this method is that its making only a single API call to pass the entirety of the update metadata at once so I'd assume that my updates aren't the trigger here.My observation seems to be that after 20 calls to create/insert new GitHub issues I reliably receive the ForbiddenException.  Is there some other way that I should be trying to insert new GitHub issues programmatically?  Or is using the API for this purpose maybe just not something that's really supported on public repos due to your anti-DoS policies?Also, another thought: if there's no way around this due to your anti-DoS ruleset for the API, can you advise the duration between create/insert calls for which I should be pausing in order to artificially slow down the frequency of my calls to the API to create the issues so as not to collide with your rule?Since (once it works!) this is just a one-off run of this process for me and there are only 57 issues, TBH I don't really care if I have to let it run overnight with a 1? 5? 10? minute Thread.Sleep() call inserted in between iterations through my collection of records ...Could something like that be a possible work-around...?Thanks again for any input here~!",,,,,,
67795998,638,Issue,"Just circling back on this to offer back my own solution in case anyone should hit upon the same limitation in their interactions with the GitHub API: trial and error has permitted me to reverse-engineer that the limits on create API calls (at least for issues!) appear to be as follows:- a max of 20 API calls within a 1-minute periodEventually I was able to solve this by following my own advice of artificially reducing the frequency of calls to the CREATE parts of the API to permit my code to fall below the threshold that seems to be triggering the violation of the anti-abuse rules. I added a line in my code to temporarily suspend/pause my thread making the API calls for 70s (60s + a comfortable margin of 10 additional seconds) after every 20th call to the API.  Using this approach, I was ultimately able to complete the full programmatic import (and subsequent updates) of all 57 of my issues.For the insert/create of all 57 issues, this added two pauses of ~70s each to my processing time, but for my (non-high-performance) needs this overhead was still entirely acceptable.  Since the update actions aren't similarly limited (beyond the 5000 API calls per day permitted by an authenticated user), there was no need to insert the same 'pause' logic into the update processing API calls in my code.Hope this helps someone else who finds themselves faced with the same challenges in trying to interact with public repos; for now I'll close this as not being anything really requiring action (beyond perhaps a consideration for a possible mention somewhere in the general API docs re: what the throttling parameters are for the CREATE-related API calls on public repos even when you're properly authenticated -- and that this suspend-until-restricted-duration-passes pattern is a potential work-around to those limits that still remains true to the _intent_ of the API throttling/anti-abuse rules).Thanks again for the help/guidance; much appreciated!",,,,,,

Please note that this does only NTLM/Kerberos style authentication and never Basic/Digest, so your credentials are never exposed to a rogue proxy.I'm not sure why this isn't enabled per default in .Net. See here for additionally comments:",,,,,,
59843502,593,Issue,"Good question! Using versioned media types like `application/vnd.github.v3+json` are a great way for the API to stay backwards compatible between versions. Right now, Octokit.net only needs to support v3. It is foreseeable that when the API revs to v4 we would need to provide v4 types to serialize from and deserialize to.With that in mind, I don't think we should openly invite people to change the `Accept` header because, as a client wrapper I think it is our job to provide client side compatibility between media types. We could provide a way to amend the `Accept` header with `text` or `html` for example. Sorta like a mixed mode response. Octokit.net would always default to `v3+json` but allows you to specify an optional mode. Because `application/vnd.github.v3.html+json` for example only add's an extra property `body_html` and does not remove or change the response structure beyond that, the client side remains compatible.",,,,,,
59847040,593,Issue,"A historical example of this is around READMEs for a repository.You can grab the raw Markdown like this:Or just go straight to the HTML:Now I'm not saying this is a good example, but I would definitely lean towards hiding away the HTTP plumbing and making it clear through the API what you're getting.At a hand-waving level there's a couple goals I have in mind:- make it easy to discover **where** you can get different content types (lol Intellisense lol)- make it easy to **switch** between content types, without having to change your code significantly If you want to kick around some ideas, what did you have in mind for the client API? Are there things you think we should be doing differently?",,,,,,
59854789,593,Issue,"I agree with you 100% about hiding away the HTTP plumbing and I do like how the `GetReadmeHtml` is implemented vs the `GetReadme`, especially since they return different data structures.I guess what my real question was is regarding how, if at all, this can be applied to something like the comments of commits, pull requests, etc... since `body_html` or `body_text` fields come and go based on the media type where (on which objects) do you stick these members?For example, 1. Do you take existing response objects like `CommitComment` and stick in a ""BodyHtml"" member which may or may not get filled based on what the media type is? Perhaps the `GetComment` method has another parameter `withHtml` which triggers the media switch from json to json+html.2. Do you mimic what `GetReadme` has done and create a whole new function `GetCommentHtml` which returns a `CommitCommentHtml` object which inherits from `CommitComment` and adds the ""BodyHtml"" memeber.",,,,,,
59864927,593,Issue,"So  and I just kicked around a couple of things and I noticed that the `beta` behaviour is no longer supported: We don't actually lock the version to v3 anywhere in the codebase, so I think that's something we can/should do in the short term to ensure consistency.There was also a gap in my reply that I didn't acknowledge which  raised about letting the user specify the `Accept` header. I'm not averse to trying that out, but given the usages are relatively specific (we know which endpoints support different media types, and it's mostly around content) we've avoided doing this up until now - or the contributors have been happy to just consume Markdown.I thought there was another place where we did this but I can't find a good example here to point to history. So I'm :cool: with someone proposing a better solution than what we've currently got. PR review comments might be a good candidate for this, as that API is done.",,,,,,

Perhaps as simple as an enum for each of the version3 types we support. Open to ideas. Like I said, because we are talking about media types within a version, each of these 'sub media types' only add extra properties to existing types. We can easily support this without creating a whole new set of types to deseralize onto.",,,,,,
59866112,593,Issue,"We can easily support this without creating a whole new set of types to deseralize onto.That'd be a good thing to test out before we dive into this - does our current deserializer support mapping ""body"" or ""body_html"" or ""body_text"" to the same CLR property?",,,,,,

58698988,587,Issue,"Should we allow changing it after the `Connection` has been created?As in overriding a hypothetical `IConnection.Timeout` property? Perhaps. That would be relatively easy to expose if you want to do things more granularly. Setting the timeout for all requests is ok, but I think it would be more useful to set a timeout for a specific upload call, as it may be significantly larger than the default for other calls.Sure, but what's the harm in doing this globally? I'd love to avoid over-complicating this API, I just wish I had a second example to go alongside uploading assets to say doing it globally is a saner approach. Also, again specific to uploads, is it worth setting the timeout to null?OK, this one interests me. `HttpClient.Timeout` isn't a nullable `TimeSpan` but you could just pass it `TimeSpan.MaxValue` and achieve the same effect...Perhaps that's the compromise here, so you can do this sort of code: do you keep the `GitHubClient` around for multiple actions? Or would you dispose of it after the uploads are done?",,,,,,
58732969,587,Issue,"Typically we keep the client for a few actions, mostly create the draft release + upload assets to that draft.Usually upload timeouts would be large, so setting it globally I don't want to wait 60 minutes to find out the release creation was the one that timed out.

I've got a fix for this in  which I'll push out with v0.5 Another one is when deserializing a bool that can be null (It happens when receiving a webhook callback with mergeable property that is ""bool"" but had a null value in the payload).

So when package A depends on version XYZ of JSON.NET, and package B depends on an different version of JSON.NET, you might get issues like:- unable to upgrade as existing/new packages depend on incompatible versions- strong naming issues (not so bad these days as the AssemblyInfoVersion is fixed for major releases)But JSON.NET is relatively stable library these days at the core so you should be able to depend on the latest version and be happy, but I've been happy with using SimpleJson (and contributing some patches upstream for things I've needed) and the benefit of SimpleJson is that it's internalized, so it bypasses all the possible incompatibilities you might see when dealing with NuGet dependencies...",,,,,,

With the reversion, it looks like you are unable to set the Labels to null, which as we discussed above, prevents you from _not_ modifying that field during the PATCH. E.g. You either have to know what the labels were set to previously, or you'll end up unsetting them all (empty array = no labels)",,,,,,

Looking at that GET request however, it should return an array, even if there is a single object, and the GitHub API does just that.The only time an object is returned is when the reference matches an endpoint, such as a branch commit when doing [`refs/heads/master`] or a specific pull commit [`refs/pull/507/head`] or other similar items.  However, when not at an endpoint, an array is returned [`refs/heads`] even if there is a single object being returned.After looking into this much more closely, I think we should close this Issue and #439 without any changes.

41225879,467,Issue,So is this ready to merge? Any tests?,,,,,,
41226343,467,Issue,the tests now fail for a different reason (malformed URL not returning results) rather than the NullReferenceException which was previously occurring. I don't think it's worth spending more time on this fix.,,,,,,

41226549,467,Issue,"Oh, right. I'll add a unit test to catch this regression...",,,,,,
41770390,467,Issue,So that last failing test is this one:And that's unrelated to all this. If it's still occurring after the merge I'll log an issue and investigate.,,,,,,
41103213,466,Issue,Thanks! :thumbsup:,,,,,,

41137887,464,Issue,thanks,,,,,,
40912334,463,Issue,we've got a suite of [integration tests] which we use to test the library against the API.What would you like to see in terms of documentation?,,,,,,
40933464,463,Issue,"First, i'd like to apologise if my ticket sounded offensive, but i was a bit angry... By documentation i mean a website or at least a text document, where all the functions will be described and maybe even with some examples like authorization etc...",,,,,,
41142000,463,Issue,"maybe if you make a wiki in this repo and give me access to it, i may be able to dig through the in-code doc and put together some tutorials/examples/whatever...",,,,,,
41174474,463,Issue,"Rather than a wiki, maybe we should create a gh-pages Jekyll site with docs.",,,,,,
41195449,463,Issue,"sure, but i think it's better to have it ""under one hood""... And the wiki is made for this so..",,,,,,
41196054,463,Issue,it'd be under one hood. It'd be a branch of this very repository and could be versioned with the code base. We could even make it part of the  site.,,,,,,
41196265,463,Issue,"all right... so, when you make it, please let me know, i'd like to help you with the docs..",,,,,,
41218866,463,Issue,Something that'd be even easier to do (and portable to either a wiki or a gh-pages site) would be just a set of Markdown files under `docs`. Seem legit?,,,,,,
41225854,463,Issue,"Yeah, let's do that for now.",,,,,,
41313866,463,Issue,"in the meanwhile, I hope this blog post helps you get going.",,,,,,
41949778,463,Issue,So we just shipped an improvement to the wikis. I'm now open to trying them out as our documentation.  what do you think? Experiment with it?,,,,,,
71155464,463,Issue,"Sorry for  intervening, but is there a way to request list of public repositories as in   ?",,,,,,
71574516,463,Issue,this seems to have been overlooked. I've opened  to track adding it to the API,,,,,,
151809771,463,Issue,"why not go with the jekyll option, I do not mind getting the experiment rolling?That way we can be consistent with our ruby brethren. Anyhow if you do decide to go down that route, would you mind creating the gh-pages branch and nuking it for me, so I can start from there?Better than me creating a PR that contains deletions to sooo many files, I can simply start with **jekyll new** when I make my first PR for the documentation.- Get all documentation on one page (then split them up as we go along into tabs or whatever)- We need a link to an svg of the octokit.net logo- Use the markdown docs already created as the content for nowLet me know your thoughts on this.",,,,,,
151985168,463,Issue,"I'm down for that. ? If you agree, I'll create the branch.",,,,,,
151990008,463,Issue,"Not sure why I didn't raise this sooner, but I like how ReadTheDocs does this. Here's ReactiveUI's as an example:  - and the relevant PR - This is slightly different from the `gh-pages` approach for a couple of reasons:- it's markdown'd already - we've got some docs as a starting point- docs are alongside the code - easier to keep things in sync than with Pages- docs use tags to represent [versions] - we don't get this for free with a vanilla Pages siteFor style and stuff we can work on that after getting something going - I just feel this is a better starting point that a vanilla pages site.",,,,,,
152004068,463,Issue,"I would like to second the notion of not using gh-pages. There is a project I contribute to,  and updating the docs are a pain in ...  ... In other news,  there is  a little nifty tool I saw recently : .  I wonder if that can be hooked up which might make it easier /simpler to write the docs, which in turn ups the chance of them getting written.",,,,,,
152020989,463,Issue,readthedocs is cool too :+1: aspnet vnext is using that. The default styles look really good.Would we care too much about having documentation for different versions for octokit.net? Seems like an overkill for this library.,,,,,,
152021150,463,Issue,"Would we care too much about having documentation for different versions for octokit.net?It's something you get ""for free"" if you're tagging releases (like we are) - so I don't see it as much work for us.  But yeah, it's a minor bonus.",,,,,,
152021703,463,Issue,"Ok, we will need to create an account for readthedocs and import the markdown files into it I think. Shall I let you handle the account creation so admin rights are on your end - assuming that's how it works? (Never used it before but more than willing to help out on this).",,,,,,

It then returns either a list with a single file, symlink or submodule, or a directory listing. We could then provide extension methods that has relevant return values (and other validation?), e.g. `FileContent`, `SymlinkContent` or `SubmoduleContent`. This means that you don't have to know what type the content is before doing the call, but you have to cast (`OfType`) afterwards. I pushed a commit to show what I mean. It's basically what  mentioned in #231.",,,,,,
38002834,434,Issue,"Actually, the more I think about it, the more I'm leaning towards differentiating `GetFile`, `GetSymlink`, `GetContents`, etc. and just throw if you mess up.

In that way you don't get the overhead of fetching the parent directory and checking the type up front...",,,,,,
39420159,434,Issue,Hey guys! Sorry I haven't been able to pull this through. I might have some cycles this weekend to take a look at it again.  Do we really want to do it this way?

39806307,434,Issue,"let's do the simplest thing that could possibly work and iterate from there- implement a `Get` which takes a path and returns a file- if the response is a collection (how to check this depends on the implementation), `Get` should throw to indicate the path is not a file- implement a `GetForDirectory` which takes a path and returns a list of items- if the response is an item, `GetForDirectory` should throw an exception to indicate the path is a file- other bad things happen due to misusing the API, just bubble them up to the userHow does that feel?",,,,,,

36345699,405,Issue,"I submitted the pull request, so I will be the first to jump into the fray.First, let's make sure it is clear what we are talking about. This issue is about [Strong-Name Signing], not [signing the code with an SSL certificate] purchased from a signing authority.Strong-Name signing just provides managed assemblies with a globally unique identity, whereas the second is used to verify the publisher of the application, in this case GitHub. The signing key for strong naming is just a key that a developer creates on the command line and checks into the repository. Ideally they would be secured, but that does not work for open source projects.Public libraries should always be strong named otherwise they cannot be used by applications that are strong named or in Click-Once deployments. In my case, I am working on a Visual Studio extension which should be strong named. I can get around it, but that will limit what I can do in the extension.Look around at most of the most popular non-Microsoft open source libraries, they are all signed and are not putting artificial limitations on their users. Here is a short list, [Newtonsoft.Json], [NUnit], [NLog], [Ninject], [DotNetOpenAuth], [log4net], [AutoMapper], [Castle] (Windsor, MonoRail, etc). In all cases, their keys are in their repositories.If you want to troll around your bin directory and see what is signed, `sn -T Ninject.dll`So, to sum up, Strong-Name signing costs you nothing and allows your library to be used everywhere and play nice with others.Okay, who's next? Gloves off, Internet fight time...![Internet Fight]",,,,,,
36357725,405,Issue,"LOL.This is an issue on another public project I _try_ to help with.Let me throw this idea out there that I've been toying around with.  (Disclaimer: I've seen the idea on a few projects so it's not an original idea.)What if we were to set up the build server to generate two different sets of assemblies, one _Strong-Name_ signed and one not signed?  As a byproduct it would also generate two sets of NuGet packages.  The unsigned NuGet package would continue to have the same name.  The signed NuGet package would be named something along the lines of ""Octokit-Signed"".The one downside to introducing signed assemblies, _only_, is that it could lead to assembly version redirect issues for end-users.  log4net ran into this issue and got a little backlash from it.I'd like to think it makes people on both sides of the fence happy.  Thoughts?![tumblr_mh3kaa1r0m1qffb31o4_400]",,,,,,
36367167,405,Issue,"Two sets of NuGet packages is very bad for libraries that other libraries depend on. What package should they reference? This might not be as big a deal for Octokit.net.I believe that eventually, strong naming as we know it will be burnt down by the CLR team and replaced with something better.Using Octokit in Visual Studio seems like a core scenario to me. I would be :thumbsup: to taking the JSON.NET approach.1. Strong name Octokit.net and Octokit.Reactive.2. Freeze the assembly version at 1.0.0. The CLR assembly version of these DLLs would never change again.3. Continue to increment the NuGet version.In this plan, NuGet becomes the unit of deployment, not the assembly as has traditionally been the case with .NET.By freezing the assembly version, we don't have to worry about binding redirect problems in the future. Octokit is pre-release right now so I don't care about introducing breaking changes like this at the moment.",,,,,,
36367506,405,Issue,"Also, while you should never rely on strong name keys to verify an assembly, I do worry that people still do.

We've been having the same discussions over on the NUnit team recently, but at least we have the advantage that unit tests are recompiled often.As for keeping the key private, if you want to, you could have the build check for the existence of a key and generate one if it doesn't exist. Then you just need to drop the key in on the build server.That said, from my experience, most open source projects just check it into the repository. I think the downsides of that are much lower than the consequence of ever losing the official key which would be a breaking change if you had to regenerate it.

41644458,405,Issue,"I've also wasted more time on strong naming binding redirects than I care to repeat, and I've been strongly opposed to strong naming ever since which IMO it's incompatible with OSS and continuous delivery that disrupts the iterative OSS workflow, introducing friction in forking, making use of customized builds and contributing back changes.If you make your SN key public, just so forks can actually test their customized builds than that pretty much negates one of the major reasons why CIO's were asking for it in the first place (i.e. under the perception of increased security), in this case all we're left with is that we need to strong name to support existing users who can only use strong named dlls, with the original rationale negated.Eventually I've had to add support for strong naming in ServiceStack v4 as it's a popular requested feature of ServiceStack's enterprise customers who wish to use it in enterprise products (e.g. SharePoint) that mandate it. But as I didn't want to burden the majority of the user-base (myself included) who don't want it, I've added a parallel track of Signed packages with a **.Signed** suffix . It takes more effort on my side, but with this approach we can mitigate the effects of strong naming to only customers who really want it and are more likely hardened to deal with their effects.The one exception is the ServiceStack.Interfaces project which is always signed as it provided the most value with the least impact since only the binaries that requires sharing is the DTO dll which only needs a dependency on SS.Interfaces, and the only way for them to be shared with both Signed/Unsigned projects is to be signed. It's done in the least intrusive way where we keep the `[AssemblyVersion]` constant and resort to updating `[AssemblyFileVersion]` to report the true version number. Because its Signed only we're realistically able to make ""official"" changes and builds of ServiceStack.Interfaces and not any of the forks who are maintaining their own customized builds. This is only manageable because SS.Interfaces is rarely updated so has created minimal friction, it does mean anyone else either have to workaround solutions not making changes to SS.Interfaces or propose changes that have to be implemented on my side, then notify them when updated builds are available.I would've preferred it if strong naming had never existed, if it didn't CIO's would've thought twice if it was justified, if it was concluded some verification was needed, then the simplest solution that worked would've been created and not the unnecessary complexity imposed on us today causing an artificial divide between signed and unsigned packages and the support burden it generates. It doesn't in most other platforms and they're better off without this imposed artificial complexity that continues to plague .NET to this day.In future I see both the GAC and strong naming being marginalized whose benefits doesn't justify their existence. SN makes more sense if software was sealed and delivered waterfall, but by its nature software is continually evolving and updating where we're striving for fast iteration times, continuous delivery and replay-able automation. We're pretty far from this in .NET (and may never get there during our Careers), but I see the nirvana dev environment is to move to a more live-reload source-based module system where we can simply reference GitHub repos as dependencies and be able to run C#/F# as source files directly (i.e. by-passing devs seeing/dealing with dlls or other interim artefacts themselves) which I also see as one of the major appeals of projects like ScriptCS. Making a change in this world is just editing source code + hitting replay, likewise making a change upstream is simply updating modules after merging your pull-request (or can even switch reference to use your own fork). There's no place for strong naming in this world, it only hinders it.",,,,,,

No matter what you do no one will be completely happy but that is the best solution I have found for keeping the most people happy., are _you_ happy with this? Would you do it again? Would you do it for a library like Octokit.net which is different in nature than JSON.NET. I'm just curious about your opinion given your experience.I mentioned that Octokit.net is different in nature and I should explain what I mean. JSON.net is a pretty fundamental library. It's the type of library that many other libraries need to reference. Thus the applications that reference _those_ libraries are affected if JSON.NET doesn't strong name.But I don't expect many other shared libraries will reference Octokit.net. I'd expect it would be referenced directly by applications. Therefore my gut is that the need to strong name is not as strong.If my assumption is correct, strong name isn't the only solution to the issues raised here.

E.g if we IL merge in some version of automapper, how can our users reference and configure automapper themselves and have our framework pickup those changes?

Both are strong named and both have a newer version (thus X has a dependency on Y vNext). With strong naming you cannot handle this scenario (but as a developer, I would strongly recommend to update Y anyways).**Pros**1) People can decide whether they want to strong name themselves (both ways are working with strong named assemblies)2) You can use assembly redirects in your config files (and then it is up to the user whether he wants to redirect breaking changes versions (as in 3.x => 4.x)3) Assemblies can be used in the GAC4) You can load multiple assemblies with different versions (think for example of serializable objects (please, don't start a discussion on serialization techniques here)5) You can use the product **with NuGet** in products that require strong named assemblies (Sharepoint for example if I am not mistaken)6) No need to mess around with ILMergeI hear some people that see strong naming as a major drawback / pain.

The mantra is easier to hold up (or atleast an easier sell) for OSS frameworks vs libraries.I too follow  approach and still see it as best of both worlds.

41665647,405,Issue,", are you happy with this? Would you do it again? Would you do it for a library like Octokit.net which is different in nature than JSON.NET. I'm just curious about your opinion given your experience. I'd sign again. Binding redirects can suck for people, and I've done my best to minimize the need for them, but it is no where near as bad as telling someone they need to ILMerge your library.I have noticed a lot of people don't understand strong naming, and blame other problems on it. Back in the day I released a new version of Json.NET that had a relatively uncommon breaking change in it and that was the version Web API picked up. Unfortunately RavenDB was hit by the breaking change. Lots of people incorrectly blamed strong naming but really the two frameworks/apps depended on incompatible versions of Json.NET and until RavenDB was updated to the new version of Json.NET there were going to be problems, and it had nothing to do with strong naming.I don't think Octokit.NET is terribly dissimilar to Json.NET - it is more likely that the app will depend on it directly rather than through libraries which is good because binding redirects will be needed less but at the end of the day it will still be deployed with applications. I don't think the reasons behind strong naming are terribly good but you have a choice of either going with it or spending time educating every developer/company who wants to use Octokit.NET and is strong naming on why they shouldn't strong name. I'm pragmatic and tend to go with what keeps the library usable to the most people.Edit:I should add that Json.NET gets a ludicrous number of downloads these days and I never hear about strong naming any more. I think when I released Json.NET 6, which incremented the assembly version for the first time in a couple of years I saw a SO question by someone about bindings and a couple of tweets with the same question and that was it, out of 1/2 million downloads.Do I hear about minor breaking changes I introduce to Json.NET: yes, but again that has nothing to do with strong naming :smiley:",,,,,,
41665679,405,Issue,Just to add fuel to the discussion strong naming assemblies post nuget instal won't always work:My project has 2 packages `PackageA > PackageB` Both are separate nuget installable packages but `PackageA` depends on `PackageB` If there was a post nuget strong name process on A and B then A won't be able to load B anymore because of a `pubblickeytoken` mismatch.My dumb approach to strong naming has always been to do an `sn.exe` sign post build but doing this on two separate dlls that depend on eachother will cause the link between them to break. So now I'm signing from visual studio / msbuild and have a complicated pre build event (both in the csproj files as well as the main FAKE build script) that generates a key to sign with in the right place before building so contributers can still checkout and F5. But sn.exe to create the keys is not something I can install locally from my build script so i have to redistribute sn.exe. Unlike i.e nUnit runners which I can install from nuget:This whole process should be a lot easier. The key reference is not relative by default if you hook it up from within visual studio. If the key does not exist in the location it should be way easier to generate one in place. SDK's should really be put in nuget as  already [blogged about wonderfully]I guess my point is that strong naming is not always something ILmerge or sn.exe post nuget install can solve. just tweeted something which to me presents a very nice middle ground:,,,,,,
41668508,405,Issue,"Thanks  it occurred to me after reading this thread that the problem isn't SN, it is what SN does to projects that rely on NuGet.  However that doesn't negate the case for SN, any more or less than shipping out multiple versions of the same assembly for different frameworks does.Here is my suggestion.  Why not treat SN as a separate platform/framework in NuGet.  Something like: **net40-sn** for a signed version of a .NET 4.0 library.If we had the following NuGet library:_\lib\net40__\lib\net40-sn_When adding this to a signed library, it would use the SN version, when adding this to a non signed library it would use the unsigned version.  And since this is merely a convention, it wouldn't effect any libraries that currently us the **net40** for signed libraries, because if SN isn't present than everything would simply used the **net40** libraries.What do you think, or am I totally off the wall, or suggesting something that has already been discussed to death?",,,,,,

I'm sure someone might be able to enlighten me, but I have not used it for a long time.Once you move away from the GAC the issue with trusting an assembly that you download tends to lessen. IMO signed assemblies are about defending you from someone inserting a version of an assembly into the GAC which compromises consumers of that asembly. Drop the GAC and that goes away.I'm uncertain whether that signed assemblies is still the best mechanism to then use in a package manager - it was built for something else. Establishing the credentials of a publisher, for their own packages, and the dependencies that they require needs a mechanism that is tolerant to binary compatible differences in those dependencies. Strong naming doesn't provide enough protection, once the GAC is dead, to force us to put up with incompatibility based on version increments that are not a breaking change to the public api of an assembly.",,,,,,

These AssemblyRefs will also need to be fixed up.2) If you want your library to be able to be deployed to an application with a plug-in-like environment (such as Visual Studio) strong naming is a requirement (assuming you don't want to force ILMerge on devs). If you don't, extensions with two different versions of the same library will break each other. We **won't** load non-strong named assemblies side-by-side, so whichever extension gets loaded first wins - if that happens to be an earlier version, then the one expecting a later version will break.If that environment uses the default Load-based (as opposed to LoadFrom) plug-in system, then incrementing version every release will also be a requirement, as GAC'ing your library is going to be the only way to load it side-by-side.3) With regards to the binding redirects, a couple of options:- Rely on NuGet to generate them. Unfortunately, its logic was lacking for our situations which lead to:- Having the package automatically generate them to reduce the pain. We took this approach for our packages, such as [HttpClient], [Async], etc. The downside is that you need to hook onto build via a targets file, which leads to package restore issues.- You could point consumers to turn on [Automatic Binding Redirects], a feature we added in Visual Studio 2013.

Today I use SN on my extension libraries because it's easy and it works.  Using a mangled DLL name would also solve the problem but it does have a bit more overhead than SN.

Binding redirect policiesIf SN was removed it's hard to see how the GAC could be reliably implemented.  It's rooted in the idea of strong versioning.   If SN was removed then presumably anyone could overwrite anyone else's assembly in the GAC hence it loses its authoritative nature.  I'm sure plenty of people on this thread would like to see the GAC die though but fact is that it's there, it's heavily used and IMHO there is no way Microsoft will give up on it.

41753196,405,Issue,"For the last few years I've managed to avoid any SN issues by ensuring all packages remained unsigned. During this time the only issue affecting ServiceStack packages were having to maintain a new Log4Net adapter when Log4Net bumped their version: We've been able to mitigate this by ensuring app code never had concrete references to Log4Net impls and instead only bind to the impl/dep-free interfaces maintained in ServiceStack.Interfaces. In this way only the host project decides which single concrete version of Log4Net gets used in order to avoid having to run dlls with different SN versions of the same library in the same app domain.Leading up to this I've suffered the normal SN binding hell of trying to make use of components with different dependencies on different versions of SN libraries where the solution ended up being to drop down and implement a custom assembly resolver to implement manual Assembly resolution, which needed to be revisited again when some SN dependencies upgraded.Now the pain point is primarily the overhead of maintaining parallel Signed packages which was only added in v4 based on some enterprise Customer demand. Ultimately I've decided on this as the best strategy with the least impact. The primary friction is with the Signed-only ServiceStack.Interfaces project which effectively every other project depends and I'm only able to create ""official"" builds for, this is manageable as this project is rarely updated so for the most part doesn't inhibit contributions.In the end, I'm hoping the ultimate solution in future revolves around unsigned dlls.",,,,,,
41755392,405,Issue,"(Standard disclaimer: This is entirely my opinion and does not represent Microsoft's) Good question. There's not a single bit that we can flip and everything is good[1]. The foundation of a significant number of features are built on top of them. The ones that I can think of the top of my head are: GAC, cross-AppDomain sharing, partial trust, framework unification, retargeting/portability (mscorlib-based PCL), fusion, shadow-copying, binding policy (publisher/machine/app policy, codebase refs, etc), app-local security servicing, side-by-side assembly loads, SQL CLR, plus a few more internal (to the CLR) features. This does not include any downstream impact on the tools & infrastructure built on top of the framework[2]If we were to completely remove the concept of strong names, we would need to make a decision about existing features that use it, do we remove the feature completely (partial trust would probably be an example in this bucket)? Or do we tweak these features (like Jared mentioned) to move away from requiring strong names (app-local security servicing would probably be an example)?If we do the former, this new framework looks very different to the previous version, and massively hurts adoption because a lot of code that relied on the features need to be changed or rewritten.As with any feature in any given project, the later needs to be offset against other features[3], and/or alternatives that could achieve similar result. For example, Phone[4], Silverlight & Store inherited strong names - but not the binding policy that required a strict match. This for the most part removed the ""in your face"" part of strong names from those platforms.  also proposed removing the viral-ness of strong names, which would enable enterprises that opt'd into strong names, to reference OSS projects that didn't.Thoughts?[1] Funnily enough we have tens of other conditional/#if'd for a lot of features from v1/v2, including COM, serialization, generics, but not strong names! :)[2] A good example would be any tool that made a decision on key to do something different. For example, I know immediately that some of the designers in VS and Blend would be broken by removing strong names.[3] Have you seen our new [JIT]?

Therefore, strong-named assemblies can only reference other strong-named assemblies.",,,,,,
41768363,405,Issue,"I think a lot of problems already will go away if the strict binding policies with assemblies is changed a bit. Today, an assembly has a version with 4 elements: Major.Minor.Build.Revision. It doesn't matter however which one is changed: if the assembly has a strong name, the assembly is seen as different by Fusion and it requires a redirect. If this is changed a bit, it will solve a lot of problems: What if fusion looks at it this way: All assemblies which share the same strong name and the same Major.Minor.Build version are equal, and the one with the highest Revision number is loaded. This is then controlled by an assembly scoped attribute which is by default 'off' (so if it's not there, Fusion will use the old behavior). One could extend this to let that controlling attribute tell Fusion which elements in the version can be considered 'equal' among all versions, it gives full control over what's loaded to the developer, as it should be, as the developer knows whether a change is breaking or not. This way, one could fix non breaking bugs in an assembly, strong name it and simply bump the Revision number. With the additional attribute in place in the assembly, it's just a drop-in replacement, no redirects needed. If a breaking change is added, the developer can decide to bump the build nr or minor version, to make sure the user of the assembly recompiles their code and is aware that the change is breaking: a drop-in replacement won't work, as intended, as it's a breaking change.This also solves the need for the workaround of using the fileversion as the real version with a revision number, as changing that today doesn't ripple down to users of your assembly when a bugfix release is published. I for one need strict binding policy based on versions. I don't care whether an assembly is signed or not, I think no-one really does these days, the main issue is solely about the version based binding. My runtime ships with OData support code, however as it has to support OData v1-3, I have to reference the WCF Data Services 5.6.1 assembly. There's a v6.x already but it ships with OData v4 only and isn't backwards compatible. Without strict binding policies, it would be expected that my code will load WCF Data Services v6.x, which shouldn't happen, the dependency is on v5.6.x This is just an example. As my runtime is in the middle of app -> runtime -> another_assembly, one would think that without strong names my life would be easier as changes in the strong name of 'another_assembly' would go away, but those are solely related to binding policy and it is required that _I_ control the dependency on 'another_assembly', as a breaking change in 'another_assembly' will break my runtime and therefore 'app'. No binding policy, no way to control that dependency. And please 'nuget already solved that' isn't correct. Not every assembly is on nuget.: it's enforced to ensure that the whole 'chain' is secure/trustworthy. At least that was the theory from 10+ years ago when signatures were still checked. A->B->C. If A is signed, it doesn't mean anything unless B is signed too.",,,,,,

33687925,352,Issue,"Ok, I woke up at 5 AM with a bit of inspiration about this I want to run by you. :smile:Let's take a step back and think about what the purpose of etags are in the first place. For the most part, they make caches more efficient in order to reduce bandwidth. They potentially reduce load on the server if the server has an efficient means to determine whether an entity has changed.So why should a client to Octokit.net care? Well, it allows them to make [conditional requests] which don't count against their rate limit. But this is a lot of work for a client to manage properly.**What if we did it for them?**We could maintain an in-memory cache of requests and responses indexed by etag. So if you call `GetRepositoriesForCurrent`, we'd make a conditional request and if it's not modified, we'd return the set from the cache.This in-memory cache could be replaced with other implementations. For example, you could inject a SQLite backed cache instead of an in-memory one.We don't have to be a perfect cache to be effective. We could use the most recently used approach if memory consumption was crazy. Alternatively, we could just automatically cache the etag (and not the response data) and just provide a method to make the conditional request test. This would allow clients to test if their cache is up to date.",,,,,,
33697285,352,Issue,"I didn't wake up at 5am! Mainly because I didn't get to bed until 1.But this pretty much covers what I was thinking as I was falling asleep. Just caching request/response pairs.Although I was envisioning a setup where the client was simply given the option to turn on/off caching and then optionally change the ""cache provider"" (i.e. the in-memory, file system, SQLite alternatives) Also possibly make the cache modular in some way so that you could share a cache between client instances. Not sure if people are going to be constructing clients left and right.",,,,,,

112396614,352,Issue,"Fun fact: we currently have this `IApiRespose` type which captures the relevant fields to do this:The part that I don't think we've tackled is how to apply the ETag on subsequent requests. I like pushing this down to the HTTP layer, so perhaps a wrapper like `Octokit.Caching` is still the way to go.Anyway, I'm leaning towards doing more `HttpMessageHandler`-based stuff through things like #808 - taking that to it's logical conclusion would likely support something like this...",,,,,,
113786813,352,Issue,If you plug in [Tavis.HttpCache] it will transparently take advantage of Etags/LastModified assuming you allow the response to be privately cached.  It will automatically convert a GET into a conditional if the cached response is stale and will serve the response from the cache if a 304 comes back.,,,,,,
535312267,352,Issue,"pointed me at this issue from #1636 where I added a big +1 to the issue of dealing with etags/last-modified.  mentioned that folks want support for this for caching, but for me the other big one (and the reason I commented in the first place) was dealing with concurrency issues.In my scenario I have GitHub spraying events at a webhook endpoint which dynamically scales and I have no real control over which endpoint gets the request. So the ability to query to see whether a change has occurred since I read an entity from GitHub allows me to introduce some serialization in an effort to enforce consistency (this is causing me some grief right now with check runs).For caching I think the ApiConnection support that exists today is _okay_ provided you don't have multiple threads rolling through the same GitHub client (I'm not sure if there are any protections for this already). But having something that is attached to the response or entities would be useful.The way I was thinking about this API was that it would be done via the entities, so you might end up with something like this:Behind the scenes, all types that participate in concurrency control would implement an interface which the client can use when making the request to set the appropriate headers. The act of constructing  passing in the  instance is signalling that you want to participate in the currency checks.When a request fails because of this an exception would be thrown so that the developer could react - but there would also be a non-exception version of the API, for example:Ideally you could use ETags instead of date time stamps for concurrency control as it provides stronger guarantees (making an assumption here about the GitHub backend) - but the interface that the entities implement would allow them to signal the kind of concurrency control they support.",,,,,,

Calling the wrong method in some tests, etc. If only I'd have been drunk so I had an excuse.Also seems as if testing arguments is going be an issue on the create methods since they just call into the non-reactive client. Which is being Substituted. (We do have a number of other tests in our test suite that seem to be the same way. They're just not awaited so they don't actually do anything.(`TheUpdateMethod.EnsuresArgumentsNotNull` in `ObservableIssuesClientTests.cs` as an example)So I could either add the checks in the Create method on the reactive client and the tests will pass but we'll be performing the same Ensure calls twice in actual use.(This seems to be the route taken with `TheCreateMethod.EnsureNonNullArguments` in `ObservableCommitClientTests.cs`)Or we could just be happy that it tests that the non-reactive client is being called. Knowing that it in turn is covered by argument tests.A third option would be to make the substituted GitHubClient return an actual non-reactive client for the reactive client to call into. That way we get our tests on the reactive client so that the requirement is not forgotten in case it's one day decided that it should no longer call into the non-reactive client.",,,,,,

32082594,297,Issue,Have most of this finished including some integration tests at  ; But have a language issue and a few other things I want to resolve before sending the pull request. When trying to use the name `Deployment` for the response model the compiler complains with:The conflict is with `System.Deployment.Internals`So I've currently gone with the name `GitDeployment` which I feel is a reasonable compromise although not completely satisfying. Currently leaning towards changing it to `RepositoryDeployment` as it is more in line with the API. But figured I should reach out for some input on the issue since it is part of the public API of the library.Another option obviously would just be to suppress the error and use `Deployment` despite the warning.,,,,,,
32088565,297,Issue,When trying to use the name `Deployment` for the response model the compiler complains with: `CA1724: Type Names Should Not Match Namespaces`That looks like a CodeAnalysis error. I feel like we should be ignoring it.,,,,,,
32089413,297,Issue,"Yes, it is. I assumed it was a warning (it was showing as a warning on msdn) escalated to an error because of build settings and figured there might be a reason for it.

32082952,296,Issue,"These set of API's are a little different to what we already have in that the operations are expensive. On the first request the calculation of the stats is queued up and you are returned a 202. You retry the request until the job is complete and a 200 is returned.Should Get be responsible for tracking the 202, and 200. Or do we provide a pair of operations - one to queue the job, and another to wait for its completion?The downside with the latter - the 'wait for completion' method would still need to take into account that the stats might need to be recalculated server side (which will happen on each push to master)I prefer the first option, but does anyone have any thoughts on how we want this to look on our client API?",,,,,,

So the Observable API should match the Rx + Linq idioms and the user shouldn't have to think about paging. Paging should be handled transparently as an implementation detail of the API.For the Task based APIs, that might be much more difficult and we might need to resort to parameter passing. But it's a lower level API anyways.Just to be clear, I'm not totally opposed to it, we've just been successful with extracting the implementation patterns based on what we needed in GHfW and I want to continue with that focus.

29187562,238,Issue,"Thanks for great feedback! I also think it would be better to just drop the namespaces. They provide no value in the test project, I just added them for consistency. The whitespace in the using directives is a result of R#'s ""optimize using directives"", there should be a `DotSettings` for the sln with a separate one for test projects so it would be easier for contributors to follow the coding/naming style. Want me to file an issue?I'll fix the stuff mentioned ASAP :wink:BTW, I had trouble building the sln in VS2013.

29149489,231,Issue,what are the typical use cases for this method. Will the caller know in advance?

Could we write some tests where a user comments on their own pull request?So I experimented with two users of mine:1. You can't fork an empty repository2. You can't fork your own repositoryThe way write integration tests would then be:1. User A creates a repository2. User A creates a blob3. User A creates a tree4. User A creates a commit5. User B forks the repository6. User B creates a blob7. User B creates a tree8. User B creates a commit9. User B creates a pull requestAfter this we can finally start to create / edit / delete / get review comments :smile: A few API are still missing:- [Create a blob]- [Create a tree]- [Create a fork]- [Create a pull request]I wrote one integration test that will be ignored for the moment as we need more features in order to test this. As soon as those features are ready I will happily add all the other needed integration tests.I removed the `_links` field from the object as the three links are present in other fields anyway.",,,,,,
29003349,228,Issue,How can I access the Http Code in my [Create] method?Something like this?,,,,,,
29035035,228,Issue,Something like this?Yes this worked perfectly. I commited the change.,,,,,,
29149700,228,Issue,Thanks for the PR. A few minor changes suggested but this is coming along well and is much appreciated! You probably need to merge upstream master into this now (or rebase it if you're into that sort of thing). :smile:,,,,,,
29151767,228,Issue,I incorporated the changes that you suggested.According to my testing `UpdatedAt` is set to the value of `CreatedAt` when creating a comment.After merging master into my branch I encountered a few issues:- `build.fsx` is rewriting incorrectly `SolutionInfo.cs`- `ThrowsTwoFactorChallengeFailedExceptionWhenProvidedCodeIsIncorrect` is failing,,,,,,
29559918,228,Issue,`build.fsx` is rewriting incorrectly `SolutionInfo.cs`Is that the issue where it would regenerate the `SolutionInfo.cs` with an extra `}` on the end? Run `git clean -xdf` to ensure you have the latest build of FAKE and try again... `ThrowsTwoFactorChallengeFailedExceptionWhenProvidedCodeIsIncorrect` is failingCan you provide some details about how this is failing?,,,,,,
29563178,228,Issue,I ran `git clean -xdf` and it fixed the issue for `SolutionInfo.cs` :smile: I also can't reproduce the failing test anymore! The test would fail occasionally before but I ran the `build.cmd` script multiple times and couldn't get it to fail again. The output of `build.cmd` in PowerShell is really different from what I was having before so It's probably because I has some old artifacts somewhere.Hey looks like I spoke too fast! The test failed again on my 5th build:Most likely a race condition as it doesn't fail consistently.,,,,,,
29563546,228,Issue,"thanks, I've captured that in #250",,,,,,
29599126,228,Issue,Do I need to do any other change?,,,,,,
29646036,228,Issue,"Great work! I had a couple more minor style comments. Also, be sure to merge upstream master into your branch (or rebase it if you're so inclined).",,,,,,
29668123,228,Issue,I replaced the read only fields by private setters in the auto properties and moved the constructors at the top.,,,,,,
30096764,228,Issue,I fixed the integration project. I also integrated blob and tree creation into my integration test.We still need `Create a Fork` and `Create a Pull Request`. Then I can start the testing. We also need to create a second test user in order to fork the repository (I don't think you can fork your own repository). What do you think of creating two extra environment variables:- `OCTOKIT_GITHUBUSERNAME_2`- `OCTOKIT_GITHUBPASSWORD_2`Of course this means that each developer will need two testing accounts.,,,,,,
30368781,228,Issue,What do you think of creating two extra environment variables:Maybe we can punt on these specific integration tests for now.,,,,,,
30371371,228,Issue,In this case (and if you're happy with the changes I made) I think we're done :smile:,,,,,,
30371516,228,Issue,I'll let  chime in here as he's been closer to this than I have. :),,,,,,
31188296,228,Issue,After reviewing the epic search API #226 this just needs to have master merged in.  We still need `Create a Fork` and `Create a Pull Request`. Then I can start the testing. We also need to create a second test user in order to fork the repository (I don't think you can fork your own repository).Correct. But we don't need to fork to create a pull request. If we just use a branch for the pull request does that still mean you are able to write an integration test for this?,,,,,,
31331799,228,Issue,"You're right. We don't need a fork in order to create a pull request. You can branch your own repository, commit a file and then you can create a pull request.However I still need `Create a Pull Request` to be [implemented] in order to be able to write the integration tests.",,,,,,
37169532,228,Issue,- so pull requests is now in master via #360. Would you like me to dust off this PR or would you like to wrap this up and :ship: it?,,,,,,
42120815,228,Issue,Sorry that it took so long. I've been extremely lazy :flushed: I wrote best case integration tests. Let me know if you want tests for when things go wrong too. If not I think we can close this one!Also I took the liberty to extend the timeout of the integration tests to 20 minutes (from 10) as it was consistently timing out before running all the tests on my machine.,,,,,,
43402930,228,Issue,anything else you need me to do finish up?,,,,,,
47605005,228,Issue,got any time to look at this again?,,,,,,
48563240,228,Issue,this looks pretty great (the tests all pass locally)!There's some cosmetic changes which I'll add in as part of getting this mergeable again. I'll see if I can speed up the tests as well while I'm in there.I'll do this in a separate PR.,,,,,,
28639959,227,Issue,Nice spot - thanks for the patch!,,,,,,

29149887,226,Issue,wow! There's a huge amount of work to implement this API. Great stuff! Hope you don't mind my nitpicky comments.There's a lot of places where you try to not send a parameter when it's not specified. I think that's probably not necessary. Might as well just make sure our request objects have the default value set and be fine passing them all. That way you can use the `ToParametersDictionary` method and get rid of a lot of code.,,,,,,

There's a lot of places where you try to not send a parameter when it's not specified.Cool let me look at why - something was going through my mind at that moment, I think it was because of a lot of experimenting going on. I agree it's best to pass on the defaults especially for stuff like enums.",,,,,,

29571682,226,Issue,"cool let me know what you got I made some of those fixes anyway. With regards to optional ctor args []  mentioned to not do that here  [one of the diff comments - quoting some of it below]. Please don't suppress this one. For more details:   The constructor should only have parameters that are required. The caller can set the properties of the object for all the optional fields.If you want I can add some overloads but I don't think that will be of any benefit? Optional args are better but we are trying to avoid what  said so the next best thing is to instantiate the Search Request with only the search term then customize your search however you want - we don't care.Note - if we go down this route we will offer some consistency to our users with the 3 other search requests (code, issues and users).I have one suggestion that will work sweetly - that would be to instantiate the object then maybe `chain` the other search terms.If that can even be implemented like that?Let me know what you are thinking with this...",,,,,,

Something that I'd think would have to be handled either with a custom marker of some type or by just deciding that all comments are inherited and overwritten every time. (Or some variation thereof)Implementing a custom build task that checks all types in the solution and finds the comments that should be copied is quite trivial using Roslyn. (Already threw together something that does this during lunch) I'm not yet familiar enough with Roslyn to say if it's as easy to actually do the copy and output the new source.Could also be that there are better alternatives than Roslyn for this specific task, it was just the first option that came to mind.

Maybe you know a good one to test? Make sure you pass some request parameters into the original API call.i've seen this behavior crop up when [developing my own PR](#161) based around the starred API. Try the following:- Fetch up to [this commit] in [my PR](#161)- Use the following code:When i run this, i get stuck in a bad state always requesting page 2 while the next Uri shows page 3 in the query string.## What i think is happeningSeems to me this only crops up when passing request parameters into the original call because this leaves `parameters` non-null in the `GetPage` method ([ref]).When the code gets around to getting the `nextPageUri`, the old parameters are still there and overwrite the _good_ parameters that are in the `nextPageUri` given by GH's api.## The End?i hope that was clear enough. i'm still reasoning through how all this is happening in my head.

Make it an `IActivityClient` that only has properties. Add the client you wrote as a property named `Event`.

Thank you very much for submitting it!One thing I wanted to point out right away: Nuget packages are restoredWe decided not to restore packages with Octokit. It's a relatively small library with very few dependencies. We simply commit the packages into the `/packages` folder.

We don't want to fill our build reports with a bunch of useless output, so we capture it and only display it all if it fails.However, I'd love to display a brief summary on success.

27537664,140,Issue,"Whoops! So in general, you should always do your work in a branch. Even when you're working in a fork. It makes these things easier.Probably the easiest way to fix this is to create a new branch and cherry pick your two commits into that branch.That way, the branch `issue-comments-uri` will have just the two commits you made. At that point, you can push this new branch to your fork.Then visit your fork on GitHub and there'll be a convenient button there to create a pull request.",,,,,,
27537854,140,Issue,"At this point, your fork's master branch is still messed up. We can fix that up.You should have a remote named `upstream` that points to the original octokit repository.

Take a look at the other clients, especially the Orgs client to get an idea of how clients are implemented.For example, instead of `ICollection` we use `IReadOnlyList`.We also tend to create classes specifically for creating and updating entities. For example, we'd have a `NewTeam` and a `TeamUpdate` class for the `Create` and `Update` methods.Also, for the enum, use standard .NET naming conventions (aka Pascal casing) for the fields: `Admin, Push, Pull`.Our JSON serializer will fix it up to match what is expected by the API.

27599500,131,Issue,"Great question! Let me answer the second part first: I noticed not all observable clients have been added and can't see the reason why?Some clients are ""sub-clients"". For example, when you navigate to the [Issues API] you'll notice there's an endpoint for issues. But in the right navbar, there are these other APIs such as [Assignees] and [Milestones].We've tried to mirror this structure. So the `IObservableMilestoneClient` isn't a direct property of `IObservableGitHubClient`. Instead, it's a property of the `IObservableIssuesClient`. And thus you can get to it by going to `client.Issues.Milestones`. Should `IObservableTagsClient` be added to the `IObservableGitHubClient`?This case is slightly different from the `Issues` scenario because there is no top level DB API. It's just a grouping of apis. However, I still think it might be beneficial to group all these DB related clients as properties of some `GitData` property.So what I'd suggest is this:Add the interface `IGitDataClient`. This interface would not have any methods. It would just have properties. Add `IObservableTagsClient` as a property of this new interface. Add this new interface as a property of `IObservableGitClient`/cc -ogre seem legit to you?",,,,,,
27599781,131,Issue,"I like that plan , although I think `IGitDatabaseClient` might be a better name, given the general ambiguity of `Data` (and in the API it's generally referred to as the Git DB API; not sure why we chose Git Data for the menu).",,,,,,

Similarly, the 2FA exceptions make sense to me.I'm not sure where I'd use `ForbiddenException`. I know _we_ use it in some cases, but as an API consumer, I don't know what special action I'd take when it was thrown.For `LoginAttemptsExceededException`, I don't think I'd do anything except show an error to the user. This one is helpful though because the status code alone doesn't tell the whole story.Ditto `RateLimitExceededException`, except I could see automatically retrying in some cases.As for the rest that we haven't implemented yet, none of those jump out to me as having a clear reason to exist.

26567646,85,Issue,"We have a pretty good idea which API calls will throw a 403 for actual authorization reasons, so in unexpected situations it is most likely going to be for rate limiting. I like a specific rate limiting exception because you probably have some general retry logic or message you show the user when you've been rate limited; you'd never catch that on specific calls. I'm not sure about the value of a forbidden exception; feels like you could just catch `ApiException` and check the status code.",,,,,,

26436674,83,Issue,":+1:octokit.objc [does something similar], in that it returns a cold signal (observable) that doesn't begin until subscription. However, _after_ that point, all subscribers receive the same results and the network request is never duplicated.I've gone back and forth on whether that's really a good thing (vs. an _actually_ cold signal), but it may be worth thinking about.Separately, one of the things I want to do for ReactiveCocoa 3.0 is [focus a lot more on cold signals] — perhaps even removing some ways to create hot ones — for exactly the reasons you mention. We'll see how that pans out.",,,,,,
26437490,83,Issue,"I think either a completely cold observable, or a sort-of cold observable like  describes, would work nicely for API calls.",,,,,,
26452125,83,Issue,"However, after that point, all subscribers receive the same results and the network request is never duplicated. thanks for chiming in!I can definitely see the benefit of this. This makes sure you don't make too many API requests on accident.But does that mean that `Retry` can't work unless you also wrap your API call in an `Observable.Defer` (I hope this translates over to that objective-c funny business)?",,,,,,
26452467,83,Issue,"It does mean that, yes. That's a great point in favor of making it completely cold.",,,,,,
26463876,83,Issue,"Yeah, it's a tricky trade-off. I have a feeling that a lot of people will make mistakes and over subscribe. Then again, I think the only reason people tend to oversubscribe is that most reactive APIs they use are unclear about the behavior and inconsistent. I feel like if they were all either strictly hot or strictly cold, you'd learn the right patterns and not make that mistake. That would also make operations like `Retry` meaningful.",,,,,,

26436851,82,Issue,"Nice work . This feels like a better API than putting the list in what's returned, even if I don't have a clear idea how we'd turn that into paging down the road.",,,,,,
26441836,82,Issue,"So, I actually am not so sure about this change - streaming the results in usually ends up in more complicated code for the caller and I usually prefer an IO",,,,,,
26450436,82,Issue,so we're following the lead from the Octokit.cocoa folks here. I believe this is what they do.  do you have more to say about it?We didn't want our API to reflect the paging nature of the API unnecessarily.,,,,,,
26450978,82,Issue,"Yes, octokit.objc returns a signal of _each individual object result_. I'd argue that this makes for less complicated _and_ more optimized code, since:1. You're handling values uniformly2. You're handling values as they arrive, instead of _after_ they've all arrived3. You can be oblivious to how many pages there are, and how big each page is4. You can apply transformative operators (like `Select` and `Where`) to the whole result setIn ReactiveCocoa, at least, there are operators to turn a `Signal` if desired — but signals/observables are explicitly modeling streams anyways, so why not just take advantage of that?",,,,,,
26451756,82,Issue,"You're handling values as they arrive, instead of after they've all arrivedWell this isn't exactly true, right? The first value of each page is being handled as it arrives, but the rest of the values of that page of data already arrived but effectively being buffered.",,,,,,
26451851,82,Issue,"Yeah, sorry for being unclear — I meant vs. sending a list of _all_ results (which may or may not be what  was suggesting).To be clearer, there are distinct advantages over _both_ sending lists per page _and_ sending a list of all results.",,,,,,
26452480,82,Issue,"Thanks for the clarification !  the four points  mentioned are reasons -ogre and I like this approach. It keeps the API surface very simple and clean.However, I do value your input as the resident Rx guru. Does this convince you or do you have other specific concerns?",,,,,,
26452545,82,Issue,"Note, it keeps the API simple and clean, but it will make properly implemeting things like `Take` complicated. But that's a problem we have to solve rather than our users. And even if we returned pages of data, we _still_ have to solve it.",,,,,,
26452761,82,Issue,"Why is that more complicated?In octokit.objc, the algorithm works like this:1. Create a cold signal representing the page to retrieve.2. Send each result to the subscriber.3. After all results, start at step 1 again, and concatenate with that signal.This way, disposal naturally cancels any further pagination, and this percolates down to operators like `Take`.",,,,,,
26453425,82,Issue,Here's the other reason you don't want to do this:,,,,,,
26453533,82,Issue,"Here, we see the async/await in its natural habitat: disaster.",,,,,,
26463657,82,Issue,"That wouldn't work even if we returned an `IObservable` so I'm unconvinced. In that case, you'd get a single page.",,,,,,
26463730,82,Issue,"Also, wouldn't `allTheItems.GetType();` return `Repository` in this case? When you `await IObservable` I thought you got the first `T` as the result.",,,,,,
26465083,82,Issue,It used to be that you got the first T and now it's the last T,,,,,,
26465710,82,Issue,"It used to be that you got the first T and now it's the last TWell in that case, there's no way they'd be confused and think they got ""all the repos"" right? Hard to confuse a single `Repository` with a collection of them. :smirk: In fact, if we _did_ return `List` that might be more confusing. They'd have a list of repos and might thing they got all of them when they only got the last page.At least with returning a `T`, they can't possibly think they got them all.Put another way, if someone really did want this to work:Then that person should use `Octokit` and not `Octokit.Reactive`. In core `Octokit`, we aggregate every page of repositories up and return them as the result of the `Task`. We don't really have another option because `Task` doesn't have a notion of streaming data. Unless we wanted to return a Task that had a property to get the next page of data and they'd need to await that.Therefore, if someone choosess to use `Octokit.Reactive`, I think we should be free to assume some familiarity with Rx.So given that, are there _any other_ concerns we're not seeing here?",,,,,,
26466616,82,Issue,"Why is that more complicated?Heh, it's more complicated because my code didn't work. But I just realized the error of my ways and fixed it. It works fine now!",,,,,,

426137866,2196,PullRequest,"# TL;DR* Adds new read-only property `ServerTimeDifference` of type `TimeSpan` to the `ApiInfo` class. An optional argument is added to the existing contructor.* The `HttpClientAdapter` will inject a synthetic header named `X-Octokit-ReceivedDate` into the response headers providing an RFC1123 date-time-string specifying the time as obsoverved locally on the client when the response was received. The synthetic header name is added as a publically visible constant on the `ApiInfoParser` class.* Adds a new instance method `GetRetryAfterTimeSpan` to `RateLimitExceededException` that allows clients to obtain the amount of time to wait until the RateLimit-Window resets.# DescriptionIn some scenarios it is useful to be able to calculate the appearent difference between the clock on a client computer and the clock on the server. While it is probably safe to assume that GitHub's server have a reasonable accurate clock, the same cannot be assumed for a client.As part of the standard HTTP response headers, the GitHub API server responds with a `Date` response header that gives a best-effort estimate for the current server with a 1-second accuracy.By storing the current time at the client as soon as possible after a response is received, these two times can be compared to calculate a reasonable estimate for the difference between the client and the server clocks.The server time difference is useful whenever the client deals with point-in-time information provided by the server and needs to perfom calculations on that time.An example of this is when dealing with `RateLimitExceededException`s. The exception instance as well as the `ApiInfo.RateLimit` instance for the last request both provide the time when the next Rate-Limit window starts. If a client does not have an accurate clock, it will not be able to calculate how long it needs to wait until the next rate-limit-window starts.By exposing the server time difference in the `ApiInfo` class, clients can easily use that information in other scenarios as well.# DetailsIn order to keep fluctuations of response processing as small as possible, the received time must be captured as early as possible, preferably immediately after the HTTP headers have been received.In order to keep the changes to existing types and methods as small as possible, the information is stored as a synthetic HTTP header in the response.If for some reason the new synthetic header value does not exist, or if the server did not repost a server time (by omitting the `Date` header), the server time difference is assumed to be 0.If both the client and the server have reasonably accurate clocks and agree on the current time, the server time difference will be close to or exactly equal to `TimeSpan.Zero`. In such cases, the only deviations are caused by network processing and propagation delays.# ExampleFor the following examples, both the server and the client are assumed to observe their local time in the UTC-timezone. All calculations use round-tripping time formats, automatically accounting for differences in time zones. Furthermore, this example assumes a network request to be instantaneous.The current time as observed by the sever `api.github.com` is `2020-06-01T12:00:00Z`. The client currently observes the time `2020-06-01T08:00:00Z` (being 4 hours behind GitHub).The client receives a rate-limit exceeded response GitHub states that the window will reset at `2020-06-01T13:00:00Z`.If the client uses its own clock, it will now have to assume that it needs to wait for 5 hours until the next request can be made.Instead the client can extract the server time from the HTTP response (the `Date` reponse header) and compare that time against its own clock. The result of the comparison will result in the time-span value `-04:00:00`. This difference can now be added to the Reset time of the exception, resulting in `2020-06-01T09:00:00Z`. Using that time, the client will correctly assume that it needs to wait 1 hour until the next requst can be made.## Code Example",,,,,,

As you've done we can add `DateTimeOffset` versions of everything and flag the old ones as `[Obsolete]`.  They will be deleted from the code base in 2 releases time.In terms of the tests, im not sure I like the complexity of adding the enum and switching out the request code, as once you take my other comment into account (and actually test the formatted date/time string) there will be a 2nd point that needs to switch.  IMO it would be better to just leave all the old tests completely untouched and just copy them for DateTimeOffset versions.  As I say, the deprecated stuff will be removed in a couple of releases time so I dont think the test complexity needs to be introduced, would rather just copy/paste them for now, and remove the old ones later.In terms of the [Obsolete] messages, can we use these please?""This ctor does not support the time component or timezone and will be removed in a future release.

145196783,1854,PullRequestReview,"Hey  it's looking pretty good, ive made some reviwe comments/thoughts just on the Observable client since that was first in the list, but the comments apply to the regular client too.In general - I havent marked up every XMlDoc inconsistency - we will need to get the comments and param entries right, but we can focus on that once we have the main code etc done- we should think about the naming of the mehtods corrresponding to ""find"" endpoints as im not sure `Getxxx` is the best for those.  I suggested a couple of options - which do you think sounds better?- since the authentication for github apps, installations and user-to-server oauth is so complex, we probably need to indicate in the XmlDoc comments of every endpoint what type of auth it requires- any endpoint taking repo `/repos/:owner`/`:name` we also by convention, support the ""undocumented"" endpoint `/repositories/:id/`Also im not sure of the historic reasons but the main client and interface for both the Observable and normal clients live in the top level folder with all sub clients in the Clients folder below there.  I see you renamed/moved the Observable one into the Clients folder but didnt do the same thing for the normal client.  In general id say we shouldnt move things since it makes tracing history more difficult, unless its a really good reason... and if you think it IS a good reason, we should at least be consistent and do it for normal and observable 😁",,,,,,

Firstly, because other search criteria (eg Labels) don't do this, so this would mean behavior isnt consistent...

176931629,1788,PullRequestReviewComment,"I was trying to keep the code simple, so decided to add quotes for all the cases, rather than add them only when there are spaces in the value. Sure, from consistency perspective I see your point.That will then leave the responsibility of specifying quotes on the user.Let's play this out, and assume that the `Milestone` property is already available. From the library user's perspective, I would just see a property to set the milestone filter, so I'll apply whatever my milestone value is. I shouldn't really add a layer on top of the library I use which should be aware of the internals of how the interaction with GitHub works. And that ""quoting"" is actually an internal behavior.The bottom line is, if we won't add quotes we force the library users to be aware of the internals of GitHub search API. So I still believe that adding quotes is correct. Even more, I would prefer to get another issue filed to add the quotes across all the other properties too (where applicable of course).Thoughts?",,,,,,

136568222,1654,PullRequest,"While running integration tests prepping for a release, I found that the `client.Repository.Commit.GetSha1()` call was returning `null` rather than the expected `string` sha1.This turned out to be a situation where when the API went from preview to official ([announced here]], the old preview header is no longer able to be used (despite the blog post saying it is!).I contacted GitHub support who informed me that the blog post was incorrect in saying the preview header would still work - unlike normal API previews where the accepts header just enables additional/changed json response fields, this particular API call actually had an entirely new media type response (a string SHA1 rather than a json payload) and therefore it required the proper header once it was out of preview.  They also allayed my fears that we need to not send preview headers once things are official, as for the ""normal"" cases it doesnt matter if we keep sending preview headers, since the new response formats will be returned anyway (and the preview headers help us support older GitHub Enterprise versions, where the feature is still in preview).

133845603,1645,PullRequest,"## BackgroundAs part of the [Events API], `Activity` responses are retrieved that contain a `Payload` field which varies according to the event in question.   In Octokit, we implement the `Payload` field of the `Activity` response model as a base type of `ActivityPayload` but [specific inherited payload classes] such as `IssueCommentPayload`, `PullRequestEventPayload` etc are assigned to this field via some deserializer ~~hackery~~ [MAGIC] 😀 ## ProblemWhen GitHub API implements new event payloads, the payload cannot be obtained via Octokit until a response model class for the specific payload is added (and the [magic switch statement] is updated).  It actually turns out that GitHub API has currently [37 event payloads], and only 8 of these are implemented in Octokit.net! 🤔 ## What does this PR do?Whilst we should implement all of these outstanding payload types (and any future ones!) (see #1646), this PR aims to add a generic ""workaround"" to Octokit so that in addition to the specific `Payload` response model classes, there is a `PayloadJson` field containing the raw json of the event payload.  This field can be used by consumers to obtain the payload of all events - regardless of whether they are yet implemented in Octokit or not.A picture tells 1000 words so here is some debugger output showing what the `Payload` and `PayloadJson` fields look like for an implemented and unimplemented event type: (implemented in Octokit)The Payload is of explicit type `IssueCommentPayload` (and `PayloadJson` is also available) (not currently implemented in Octokit)The Payload is of base type `ActivityPayload` and doesn't provide anything useful, but the `PayloadJson` is now available and can be used by clients to at least understand this event prior to a Model for it being added to Octokit.net## Implementation NotesImplementing this required some tweaks to the deserializer so that we can have more than one response field that maps to the same API value (eg in this case the API field `payload` maps to both `ActivityPayload Payload` and `string PayloadJson`).  To limit the impact, I added a new field to the `[Parameter]` attribute we use, that explicitly marks the parameter declaration `AllowDuplicates`.  In the internals of the deserializer, it then appends a unique value to the api field (so it can be stored in the dictionary for the `SetterCache` along with other instances of the same api field).  In the case of `PayloadJson` it would end up in the `SetterCache` as `payload_octokit_payload_json`.  Then when populating models from the api response it removes this appended text from the dictionary key, so it can find the correct API field (`payload`).  It's a bit hacky but IMO no more so than the existing ""magic"" that was switching out the classes derived from `ActivityPayload` base class in the first place.A 2nd deserializer tweak was needed so that an entire `JsonObject` could be written to a `string` property (by calling `.ToString()` on it) - this is used so that the `payload` API field (a `JsonObject` structure) can be mapped to our `string PayloadJson` field.I also fixed up the existing Event payload integration tests which were previuosly skipped due to them looking for events that are too long ago.  I tweaked them to use our pagination support to keep searching until they find an event of the desired type.  We also now have an integration test for each of the 8 payload types octokit currently supports.  NOTE that there is a chance that these tests can fail if we hit the pagination limit of the events API before we encounter an event of the desired type but this is acceptable for the time being IMO",,,,,,

114281063,1595,PullRequestReviewComment,"It seems it is currently, eventhough I agree the implicit conversion should mean it's not.  Ive traced the reason:   corresponds to an api value of `utf-8` but our response enum doesn't include a custom `[Parameter()]` attribute on the members.  We still deserialize the API value OK, since the deserializer removes underscores and hyphens... but when we are converting this back the other way (ie with the changes I made in `StringEnum`'s `ctor` we have no way to know that `EncodingType.Utf8` should be `utf-8`.  To fix this, of course we could add the attribute to this enum, but there is nothing that stops this situation from existing on any other enum value that is only used in API responses.  When an enum is used in a request we HAVE to know what the correct api string value is, but when only used in responses we dont currently (need to) know the value.One possibility would be to enforce (via convention test) that all enums (both request and response) have custom `[Parameter()]` attributes set.  Although this could be a fair few edits, it is the most explicit and obvious approach.  It would also let us remove the ""magic"" removal of hypens and underscores in the deserializer, instead only ever relying on explicit parameter mapping attributes.  Thoughts?",,,,,,
114281231,1595,PullRequestReviewComment,I was trying to avoid changing too much about the current deserializer code.  Both the underlying `GitHubSerializationStrategy` (which implements an interface) and the actual `SimpleJsonSerializer` both use instance methods rather than statics.,,,,,,

117586621,1595,PullRequestReviewComment,"I _think_ I found the issue. The enum cache dictionary is not filled with all the values of a specific enum, but only with the value we want to deserialize when calling the method.

Am I missing something here and this is the desired behaviour?",,,,,,
117588086,1595,PullRequestReviewComment,"Yeah that does seem like a logic flaw. The idea of the cache is to obviously ""speed up"" the enum deserialization by not having to evaluate the Parameter property on an enum value more than once But that seems to be a logic issue where only the first enum member encountered would be added to the cache...  then next time (for the same enum type) the enum type would already be in the cache (but not other members) and it would actually never look at the parameter property on other members and only do a `Enum.Parse` on themUnless I'm missing something,  this line should have actually led to bugs where we ignored the parameter attribute on any enum members other than the first one encountered? How has this not led to other problems in the past! :confused:So yes I think removing that line is fine but now I want to understand how  this hasn't already caused us problems before!",,,,,,
117715944,1595,PullRequestReviewComment,"Yep I confirmed this was a bug, and added a failing test to repro it.  If the same `SimpleJsonSerializer` instance tried to deserialize a subsequent enum value that required the Parameter attribute (ie `EncodingType` ""ascii"" followed by ""utf-8"") it would throw an exception as it hadn't cached the other enum members, and tried to do a simple `Enum.Parse()` on ""utf-8"".I've made the fix identified by  and confirmed this test now passes, plus changed the `StringEnum` to use a static `SimpleJsonSerializer` and verified the other tests are passing.Ill push the commits up if you want to have a look  and",,,,,,

This mode generates a new version for each commit. To avoid the version going through the roof, a pre-release tag is forced with this mode. By default, the tag for `master` is `ci`. As we used the `alpha` one for the pre-release NuGet package, I thought we might use the same.Also, right now GitVersion increments the `minor` after the repo has been tagged (see [that AppVeyor build]). It looks more natural to me to go with the assumption that the next release will contain a new feature. We can always force a bugfix release by using either a release branch - `release/0.24.1` - or use the convention-based commit messages - `+semver: minor` - to instruct GitVersion of the version we want it to generate.At the moment the file contains configuration for both `master` and `dotnetcore` since it's the branch we're working on.

Normally to ""disable"" a protection setting, you can send a `null` for the object but in this case to disable the item, you have to send an empty bodied member.So basically to be disabled, as per the following screen shot, we have to send an instance of the class but with no members (ie the Teams/Users array are `null`)To enable the dismiss restriction and have only admins (as per next screenshot) you send empty Teams/Users arrays.To specify teams/users you populate themSo given that we need to somehow have either the empty bodied class or empty array or populated arrays, what i came up with was the `ctor` thqat takes a `bool` for whether the restriction is enabled (admin only, thus empty team/user list)... or disabled (`null` arrays, so the class has an empty body).I tried to explain the usage in the xmldoc comments which users hopefully see in intellisense.If you have any better ideas for implementation let me know!",,,,,,

88665831,1492,PullRequest,"When I tried to add the Octokit.net Nuget package to any of my Xamarin.iOS projects (10.0.1.10), they wouldn't install because the package couldn't target the platform. Xamarin.iOS 10+ requires that the Unified Xamarin iOS APIs be used, which is why I expect the installation was failing.I've fixed the iOS projects in-place. This is probably not the best solution, because it means that the package will break things for anyone using Xamarin.iOS that is less than version 10. I don't presume to know how you want to structure your library around those changes. A better solution would probably be to have a new set of iOS projects that target Xamarin.iOS 10+ and leave the old monotouch projects as they are. But like I said, I won't presume to know how you want to deal with that.There were also many files that were referenced in the iOS projects, but that were missing from the repo altogether.

Breaking change on `Content.Get()`. Could add corresponding ctors with bool if convert to base64.2. Insert base class `Base64CreateFileRequest` with a virtual `Content` property wich contains base64 content. `CreateFileRequest` overrides it and provides decoded content.3.

This means we have full intellisense support of the build scripts AND the ability to debug the build scripts natively in Visual Studio!So far it is building the `Octokit.Next` and `Octokit.Next.Tests` projects and running the unit tests.  I'm also experimenting with using GitVersion to calculate version numbers with the ultimate goal of publishing alpha packages to nuget on each merged PR to master as well as still supporting the official releases off a release branchEverything lives under a `/build` sub directory.  To execute the build we simply `dotnet restore` and `dotnet run` in this directory.The interesting parts are `BuildContext` which is essentially our build settings, `BuildLifetime` where we populate our settings from commandline options or other builtin helpers.  Then in the `/build/Tasks/` directory is where the tasks are actually implementedIn order to run via AppVeyor/Travis we will need `.ps1/.sh` bootstrap scripts, similar to the approach of the existing FAKE implementationSo far I have the following tasks planned:- [x] Add Cake.Frosting build for Octokit.Next projects- [ ] Add README.md file to `/build` directory to provide some info about the build script- [x] Get running in AppVeyor- [ ] ~~Get running TravisCI~~- [ ] Get sourcelink replacement (GitLinkRunner) working- [ ] Play around with GitVersion settings some more- [x] Play around with nuget publishing- [x] Decide whether to tackle the legacy octokit projects or only have this for dotnet core projects- [ ] Get feedback from maintainers and contributors regarding the use of Cake and specifically Cake.Frosting",,,,,,

76279571,1415,PullRequest,"#### SummaryThis PR implements the Authorized Ssh Key management for GitHub Entperprise Management Console- [Retrieve Authorized Keys]- [Add Authorized Key]- [Remove Authorized Key]This continues to complete functionality for #1024 and builds on top of #1269 (which is pending feedback/help from some experts!)#### NotesNot as many curve balls as #1269 but a couple of points of note- The `Delete` method actually returns a response (list of remaining authorized keys) so this necessitated implementing `Delete()` methods on `IConnection` and `IApiConnection`- The GHE Management Console errors don't seem to conform with the normal GitHub ApiErrors as they just have a simple Json property ""error"" and then a string.  But this actually revealed an interesting issue with the Json deserializer where it always returns an instantiated object of the type requested, eventhough calling code (like the `ApiError` [deserialization attempt]) is checking for `null` and then falling back to providing the `string` payload as the error message.  So I made a tweak to the deserializer such that it only instantiates the object when at least one field has been found in the payload response.  This means if it completely fails to deserialize an object to the requested type (ie no fields matched) it now returns `null` (which is what calling code seemed to expect anyway)    Note: this causes a failed test which was written way back in #714.  Need to check with  if this is OK to be changed or not.  I have skipped it for the time being- I needed to fix the `UriExtensions.ApplyParameters()` function to work with non absolute Uris that already had query parameters present.  Without this fix the new+existing parameters are appended to the end of the url string which already included the existing parameters, causing an invalid Uri  - The integration test to add/delete authorized keys is currently failing, due to the redirect await deadlock currently being discussed in this issue #1396 and this PR #1411#### Task List- [x] Regular client implementation- [x] Regular client unit tests- [x] Regular client integration tests- [x] Observable client methods- [x] Observable client unit tests- [x] Observable client integration tests- [x] Tidy up XmlDocs- [ ] Wait for #1269 to be merged- [ ] Get ok from  regarding comments above",,,,,,
75603417,1415,PullRequestReviewComment,"can you shed any light on the behaviour this test is asserting?  It seems that when you added support for Organizatino/User ""type"" on Account, you made it nullable and then have this test here to prove that it's null when deserializing a json fragment that is not a user/org/account at all.Meanwhile in this PR I found that the deserializer instantiating the requested class even when the json had no matching fields seemed to go against what other parts of the code were expecting (linked in PR body) so i changed it to only instantiate class when it finds at least 1 expected field in the json, otherwise it returns a null object.

67137913,1339,PullRequestReviewComment,Ok cool. Let me dig into this further as `ToUpdate` shouldn't create the `Labels` array by default unless it already exists on the issue. There's some [assumptions] about what we `POST` as part of editing an issue that may have changed (emphasis mine): Labels to associate with this issue. Pass one or more Labels to replace the set of Labels on this Issue. **Send an empty array (`[ ]`) to clear all Labels from the Issue.** NOTE: Only users with push access can set labels for issues. Labels are silently dropped otherwise.,,,,,,
67139802,1339,PullRequestReviewComment,That was actually my  commit I sent over to 's branch. Sorry if it's not correct but it seemed to me .ToUpdate() shouldn't clear the labels from an issue?,,,,,,
67267592,1339,PullRequestReviewComment,"it's all good, I just need to cast my mind back to the earlier discussions about this.#718 is the original PR where I implementing this, and to TL;DR it:- initially, the result from `ToUpdate()` should have a value of `null` for `Labels` - this is how we say ""don't change anything"" to the server as part of the update, as `labels` won't be serialized- if you invoke `update.AddLabel(""label"")` we create a new list lazily, and this collection **replaces** whatever labels are previously set on the server- if you invoke `update.ClearLabels()` this creates an empty list, to indicate that all labels should be removed as part of the update It's might come across as a bit explicit, but I like the verbosity that it gives you in the code.Anyway, coming back to this change. It looks like we're populating the `Labels` array from what exists in the issue, and while that's similar to the original intent I didn't want users to be manipulating the `Labels` collection directly to remove labels - I wanted to see them use the first-class `AddLabel` and `ClearLabel` methods on `IssueUpdate`.",,,,,,
67327612,1339,PullRequestReviewComment,"Yeah that's a bit odd (IMO!).I'd expect `.ToUpdate()` to give me a ""perfect"" replica of the issue, including Labels/Assignees/whatever that I can then use to update the `Issue`.  I see what you're saying about prefering `AddLabel()` and `ClearLabels()` to direct list manipulation, but if you consider the use case of where I want to add a label to something, I cant just `ToUpdate()` and then `.AddLabel(newLabel)` because that would remove all the other labels.  So I would need more code to explicitly set the labels to whatever they were originally (which perhaps if im now in some other function I dont even have the original `Issue` object anymore, I only have the `IssueUpdate` I'd passed in?  It just seems like this behaviour is a bit odd and means `ToUpdate()` didnt actually create me a ""usable"" `IssueUpdate` request for my intended usage.  Conversely if we DID include the exiting labels, and possibly fleshed things out with a `RemoveLabel()` call as well as the `AddLabel()` and `ClearLabels()` you still have a way to do everything without direct manipulation but also cater for all intended usages?It also makes me wonder now, if this is the way we currently handle multiple labels on an issue, does that mean the multiple Assignees functionality added in this PR should also take this approach?  Is the main use case REPLACING assignees or ADDING/REMOVING one of multiple assignees?  Id say the fact that the enhancement is here in the first place means multiple assignees are desirable so we wouldnt want to do things that remove other assignees...",,,,,,
67327867,1339,PullRequestReviewComment,"you might want to take a look at this too.  It's another ""tweak"" id made when pushing some changes over to  .  I think it's because now with the multiple assignees support, this field can actually be `null`, but we dont want to send it in as such or else it wiped out all the other assignees.  But I also may not have been aware of historic things similar to how I may have messed up the `Labels` handling currently being discussed!  So if you could check this out too and have a think about it etc to make sure I've done the right thing here?",,,,,,
69446771,1339,PullRequestReviewComment,"Apologies for the drive-thru comment, but maybe what we should actually have is a standard group of `SetLabel`/`AppendLabel`/`ClearLabels` methods to clearly allow for all the possible ways of manipulating the list (replacing/appending/clearing) so that users won't be tempted to manipulate the list directly and can trust the methods to do what is required?

66308665,1269,PullRequest,"This is the beginnings of adding support for #1024 the GitHub Enterprise [Management Console API]To begin with Ive only added the Get/Set Maintenance Mode functions and the actual plumbing around how we can actually integrate with the management console API.Im aware there are merge conflicts as I havent rebased to latest master yet.  We are far from done with this PR so Ill do that in good time.  For now I just want to get the [WIP] up to find out from  and  how far off track i've taken things :trollface: : ### NotesThis API is significantly different to all the ""regular"" github APIs.  There are special requirements around connectivity and authentication and it also doesnt have fully fleshed out calls that take multiple parameters, but in more than one place simply have a single parameter that takes a json string specifying multiple parameters.  To top it off it had some really strange handling around date formats and some other things.Im definitely after guidance on some of the design decisions ive made...### SummaryRead below for large detail on the inner workings and design decisions I made, but in a nut-shell someone using octokit.net against a GitHub Enterprise server an now simply call the following methods on the same `GitHubClient` client they have already created for regular API access.#### Network access- TCP Port  Since octokit handles following redirects, we don't have any issues around handling the special ports of `8080` and `8443` so we are good on this front and can simply target this API at the regular server address the user is passing into the `GitHubClient` as octokit will follow redirects as needed- API Uri's  Not as lucky on the Uri front though... The management console api calls must be targetted at `` ie they can't have the `/api/v3/` in the URL as all other calls do.  Unfortunatley in the guts of octokit.net's `GitHubClient` and `Connection` classes, this `/api/v3/` is added to any custom URL specified by the user and saved in the `baseUri` of the `Connection` object.  Originally my implementation made it so that you had to declare a new/special `GitHubClient` using a new constructor essentially stating that you wanted to use it for management console access, and this essentially passed a `bool` through which prevented the `/api/v3/` being put in the uri.  But of course this then meant that all the other API clients on this `GitHubClient` wouldnt actually work... and similarly it meant that the `client.Enterprise.ManagementConsole` client wouldn't work on a ""regular"" `GitHubClient` you were using to call the normal APIs.  My latest iteration was actually exploiting behaviour of the dotnet `Uri` appending behaviour, where if an endpoint relative Uri starts with a leading forward slash, it actually causes any Uri on the `baseUri` to be stripped off.  We've encountered the odd bug over time where inadvertently including these leading slashes on Urls in the `ApiUri` helper class has caused endpoints to not work on github enterprise, but now it seemed like this behaviour might actually help us here.  Rather than just magially include the leading slashes on the management console Uris, i implemented a function `CorrectEndpointForManagementConsole(endpoint)` that is called in each management console client method, to add the leading slash if not already there.  This does seem a bit hacky but really it is a fairly reliable way to allow a user to specify one `GitHubClient` object and credentials that work against the regular APIs on their enterprise instance, then when they use the ManagementConsole API on the same client, we manipulate the Uri via the endpoint (ie not manipulating the baseUri) and provide the management console password each time.  Plus there is zero behavioral change for anyone using octokit against github.com (ie not an enterprise user).  As an octokit contributor and enterprise user I felt like this has achieved good usability and is an acceptable code base compromise.  At least it's a starting point to see how  and others feel :)#### AuthenticatingThe management console has a special password to access it.  For API use, this password is specified as the api key, however it appears it cant be specified in the ""normal"" way the user/password or OAUTH token can be (ie using our `Credentials` object which inserts it in a header in base64/UTF8 form).  I was only able to get things successfully working, by having `?api_key=MyPassword` on the end of the Uri (or potentially it would also work being embedded in the server name `https://api_key:MyPassword` but that causes similar problems as above if we want to try and have the one `GitHubClient` object able to work with all APIsSo with the way i've implemented it on the end of the Url, it actually doesnt work too badly as it means the existing credentials provided on creating the `GitHubClient` can stay, and are used for regular API access, and every management console method takes a `managementConsolePassword` parameter.  I actually like this as it's more inline with the seriousness of some of these management console activities - eg along the lines of ""provide your password everytime you do these management related things""The irksome thing is that the password is essentiall in clear text on the end of the Url but im not sure if that's really any different to it being in the HTTP headers for regular calls anyway...#### What the heck is up with parameters containing json strings?!!The Set Maintenance Mode call takes a single `maintenance` parameter which is defined as follows: _maintenance_ `string` _Required_ A JSON string with the attributes enabled and when.I tried and tried and I just could NOT get things working in the normal way where we have a request object, which gets serialized to json and put in the body of the HTTP Post.  I had many incarnations providing a class with a public `Maintenance` parameter that then contained the c# object class with the `Enabled` and `When` parameters on it.  When that didnt work I tried simply having a public `string` Getter parameter that deserialized the class to json (didnt work), so then moved to constructing the json string in a more basic way - both normal format and fully escaped, I tried doing the parameter dictionary type approach like used in search requests, I tried the default content type and `application/json` content types but in all cases github would throw a HTTP 400 Bad Request.  Eventually I found that if I just specified the string in the url-form-encoded format of `maintenace=""{""enabled"":true, ""when"":""now""}""` it worked, so that's where I'm at at the moment.  I plan to tidy up the json string to not be created manually and instead call a serializer but for now I have something working so didnt want to wait in pushing it up.If anyone is able to show me how to get this working in a more ""normal"" way for octokit where the request object is serialized using the builtin `SimpleJsonSerializer` in the normal pipeline, I would love to see what I missed bercause I feel like I tried so many attempts and still couldnt crack it without going the form encoded route.This is definitely important to sort out a strategy for, because the [Settings] endpoint on the management console is a real doozy containing literally 50+ items in a hierarchical json structure that all have to get packed into a single json string on a `settings` property in the API call.  I am NOT looking forward to that endpoint!#### What the heck is up with the time handling?!!The response to a scheduled maintenance mode event includes this field In any other github API call ive encountered, the dates are in a lovely and easily parseable ISO 8601 format In this case we not only have the the full day and month names (this will pose issues if github can run in other cutures/languages), the silly formatting like comma and `=>` the non standard timezone offset information (in dotnet land this should be `-08:00` rather than `-0800` but most importantly THE YEAR is missing!  This plays havoc with attempting to actually parse this into a date.  Now if we hardcode a culture like `en-US` we can get around the full day/month names, and we can ""almost"" use `ParseExact()` to match most of the formatting issues, except the lack of year means we cant use `DateTimeOffset.ParseExact()` but if we use `DateTime.ParseExact()` the time zone offset is not handled well.  Given that the day of week and month are mentioned, we ""could"" potentially take an educated guess at the year, since eg if it says Tuesday the 12th April, we can figure out what YEAR in the future the 12th April will fall on a Tuesday and presume it to be this... then we could shove that year into the string.  This is clearly getting ridiculous though (espcially because this field is coming back from the API and we want it to be deserialised properly in the Json deserializer) so I took the easy way out and simply made it a `string`!!!In runtime testing this behaviour it's even more odd because through the API I can scheduled maintenance for a date in 1/1/2017 and the API response `Sunday, January 1 at 20:00` indicates it really is that 2017 date - the fact it says Sunday is the confirmation.  Yet the management console UI will show it as 1/1/2016 but in a scheduled status.  If it really was 20-16 we should either now BE in maintenance mode (not scheduled) or it should reject the update since it's in the past.  So im thinking even the management console UI itself is using this API call with the missing date and just assuming it's the current year.Now does it make sense to schedule maintenance for so far in the future?  Not really!  But given the API lets you do it, it's not really our place to limit this in any way.  My hope is that this API call gets modified to include a properly parseable ISO 8601 formatted date like all other dates in the normal APIs, and the management console GUI fixed up to know the proper year as well :grinning: In the meantime Im thinking we have to leave this field as a `string` because parsing it is too difficult and not 100% reliable.#### Other design decisions- Specifying ""when"" parameter in EditMaintenanceMode()  The SetMaintenance method `when` parameter can handle ""any"" string that the [mojombo/chronic] ruby library can parse.  This includes lots of humanised things like ""next tuesday at 5pm"" and ""3pm on the monday before friday in 3 weeks time"".  Luckily for our api case we simply have to take whatever string the user says and pass it through.  But ive also added specific suport to passing in a `DateTimeOffset` object since that is more aligned to our c# nature, and also the special `now` keyword as indicated by the API docs.  To do this i created a `MaintenanceDate` object used as the `When` parameter on the `UpdateMaintenanceRequest` object, and helper functions `MaintenanceDate.FromDateTimeOffset()` `MaintenanceDate.FromChronicString()` and `MaintenanceDate.Now()`- MaintenanceModeStatus as an enum  There appear to be finite values of `off` `on` and `scheduled` so I made this an enum.  The API docs dont definitively state the finite values though...  This isnt too different to other enums we've implemented though- Added environment var for management console password for integration tests  added to the powershell helper script and the `EnterpriseHelper` class, so the integration tests can runThat's about it for now.

This PR marks all of the `SshKey` related items obsolete, and directs users to the equivalent `PublicKey` and `UserKeysClient` implementations where appropriate.Then, in a future release, these `SshKey` related classes can be deleted.### Notes#### `Update` method is _really_ deprecatedAs per the [API documentation], the `Update()` method for `PublicKey` is no longer supported, so this method was not moved to `UserKeysClient` and instead the `[Obsolete]` property instructs the user to delete/create the key (as per the API doc).#### ~~`ModelExtensions` isn't being ported over to `PublicKey`~~~~The `ModelExtensions` class contained extension method for `SshKey` to parse out the data+name of the key into `SshKeyInfo` class.  After reviewing the code, these methods are not used ANYWHERE except in the actual unit tests for the extension methods themselves.  The methods and class have been marked obsolete, but I currently decided not to create equivalent extension methods and `PublicKeyInfo` class, for `PublicKey` implementation, given that there was no actual usage of this stuff anywhere than  in itself!  Can easily port this over though, if there is concern...~~After discussion in #1106 these extension methods and tests have been implemented (as `PublicKeyExtensions` and `PublicKeyInfo`)#### Added `CreatePublicKeyContext` helperSimilar to the other context helpers Ive been adding recently, I added a helper that allows the integration tests to create a `PublicKey` to run the tests, then clean it up afterwards.  Currently it is just a hardcoded key data, which works fine as long as the cleanup code deletes it as the context is disposed.  If/when an appropriate key generator approach is found as per #1003 which has similar issues around `DeployKey`s, this context helper could be enhanced to produce unique/random keys each time rather than the hardcoded key data, but for now it's working fine## TestsPreviously no integration tests existed for `SshKey` functions but thanks to `CreatePublicKeyContext` helper we now have full integration tests for the `UserKeysClient` and `ObservableUserKeysClient` methods.

This seemed useful to know (and also was required in order to assert the Integration tests for the Suspend/Unsuspend methods) so Ive added this field to the `User` response object (I also checked whether it should be put on the base `Account` object, but `Organization` can't be suspended so `User` seems to be the correct place for it#### ImpersonationToken methodIm not exactly sure how to actually use these!  As a GHE admin through the site admin section on the webUI we can ""impersonate"" a user and login/interact as them, however through the API you have to specify scopes on this call, so Im not sure if this is the same thing or not.  The calls as implemented do work, but Im not sure what to do with the ImperstonationToken once it's retrieved~I also wasn't sure whether there should be a new Response type for the call or if the existing `Authorization` type is appropriate.  The only field the response contains that `Authorization` doesn't have, is ""token"" however I believe that may be being deprecated anyway.  For now I've just used `Authorization` as the return type.As an aside, it looks to me like there is an issue with the `Authorization` object in that the field named [`Application`] is actually `app` in the [API response] and thus always null.  Ill raise an issue for this tomorrow...#### Naming Things (tm)Given that this API now had a mix of methods acting on both Users, ImpersonationTokens and PublicKeys I originally wanted to name the methods `CreateUser` `RenameUser` `DeleteUser`.  However given that the `Suspend` `Unsuspend` `Promote` `Demote` methods were already implemented with that naming (ie, no ""User"" suffix) and went live in the latest release, I decided for consistency to not include ""User"" in the `Create` `Rename` and `Delete` either.#### Added `CreateUserContext` helperSimilar to the `RepositoryContext` and `TeamContext` helpers, I added a helper that allows the integration tests to create a user to run the tests, then clean it up afterwards.## TestsThe integration tests require a GitHub enterprise instance so wont run as part of Octokit builds currently.  The `CreateUserContext` helper is working a treat, after running stacks of tests my test GHE server doesn't have any extraneious users hanging around :grinning: I set a couple of tests to Skip at the moment due to #1106 which I plan to fix up in the near future and then unskip the 2 integration tests.",,,,,,

However I later found that when a GitHub Enterprise instance has LDAP enabled, all requests that return a `User` or `Team` even the general GET calls, include a `ldap_dn` field, so I have added `LdapDn` field to the `User` and `Team` response objects, the xml doc notes it is GitHub Enterprise only.  This seemed preferable than having to have special types when you wanted the ldap field and it shouldnt hurt any non enterprise users having this null property on those objects.#### Added `Post(uri)` override to `ApiConnection` and `Connection` classesThe LDAP Queue Sync job commands are a POST but do not contain a body/object.  However they do provide a (admittedly trivial) response object that needs to be deserialized.  Currently all the overrides of `Post()` require a body to be passed in and assert it is not null.  There is a `Post()` that doesnt need a body, but that returns a `HttpStatusCode` and doesn't handle deserializing to a `` response object).#### Added `CreateEnterpriseTeamContext` helperSimilar to the `RepositoryContext` helper, I added a helper that allows the integration tests to create a team to run the tests, then clean it up afterwards.#### A note about LDAP call behaviourThis was a bit quirky so I thought it worth mentioning. - User must exist (obviously) and the specified LDAP distinguished name must exist (GitHub appears to validate this against the LDAP source) - Team must exist (obviously) and specified LDAP distinguished name is NOT validated.  It can be set to something that doesnt exist and is regarded as a succesful API call (and the new LDAP binding is visible in the team settings on the gui etc).(The team will then be disabled on the next LDAP sync when it realises the group is invalid)## TestsThe integration tests require a GitHub enterprise instance so wont run as part of Octokit builds currently.  Futhermore this API requires the GHE instance has LDAP binding enabled.  Also note that I have had to censor the ""distinguished name"" properties used in the integration tests so they arent company specific.  The integration tests also do NOT run against the ""current user"" because you dont want to mess with changing the LDAP binding on the user running the tests and potenitally disabling the account or otherwise losing access...  So the integration tests have a `_testUser` property declared at the top of the class (at the moment that user has to exist, as the method to add users is not implemented... though even when it was, in an LDAP enabled server any user you create would have to have a valid LDAP binding in the first place i suspect!)So with all those caveats aside, the integration tests are passing on my test GHE instance with LDAP binding to a Windows AD domain, after I set real/correct values for `_testUser`, `_distinguishedNameUser` and `_distinguishedNameTeam` properties.  I didn't feel like for this specific functionality, it was worth adding yet more environment variables to the integration test helper stuff.  Even if Octokit CI builds end up having an Enterprise server to run against, if you really wanted to run the LDAP tests you would need a SECOND enterprise server with LDAP enabled.  It seems fairly low on the priority list IMO.  But at least this API is now implemented and anyone who wants/needs to use it can.  We just potentially wont have frictionless integration test execution...",,,,,,

52857343,1099,PullRequestReviewComment,"This could just be my inexperience with the way these things are working.  The Microsoft Code Analysis stuff wanted me to put LdapDN but when you do that, the json serialiser tried to look for field called `ldap_d_n` so in order to get the API field `ldap_dn` deserialized I had to use `ldapDn` on the c# side, and suppress the warnings about ""Dn"" not being spelled or cased correctly.I didnt realise we could ""control"" what words are allowed.  Does that apply to the Microsoft Code Analysis stuff or the API field formatting stuff, or both?  There seems to be heaps of Suppress rules int he codebase for spelling and abbreviations, perhaps there needs to be a concerted effort to get rid of as many as possible, in favour of adding recognized words to this custom dictionary?I also wasnt sure if I could set what the ""api name"" of a given property is (ive seen it done on Enum entries, but then also seen mention that that method didnt work on both serialisation and deserialization).

This item still remains so that someone COULD point ""all"" integration tests at another instance (eg enterprise) if they wanted, by setting the CustomURL.  But the difference is, that all the other paramters like username, password, apitoken etc would be coming from the ""regular"" settings.Meanwhile for tests that explicitly require/target GitHub Enterprise, we use the EnterpriseHelper class which has it's own setup for username, password, api key and so on.  Basically this means that I can have my workstation configured to run integration tests against github.com and enteprise integration tests against my enterprise instance...

57759965,1072,PullRequest,"While working on implementing GitHub Enterprise APIs I came across the fact that the OrganizationMembers API implementation was missing the ""Role"" filter option (all, admin, member).  I also added integration tests for the GetAll method (previously there were none for this whole API) and all work fine in my integration tests... however I found that querying for Admin/Member role only returns correct results when the requester is a member of the organization.  When the requester is not in the organization, the member and admin filters just return all users in the org.  I also found that with the existing ""filter"" attribute (2fa_disabled, all) only owners of an organization are allowed to use the `2fa_disabled` filter, and octokit throws an exception if the requester is not an org owner.Im not sure what settings you guys run the integration tests under for octokit.net so I have set the integration tests that would have triggered these conditions, to SKIP for now.  If the integration tests on AppVeyor/Travis do run as an org member or org admin, let me know and I can un-skip the tests (i also need to know the name of the org to use in the queries... currently ""octokit"" is used).",,,,,,

49999570,1049,PullRequestReviewComment,"At first I wrote all the code based on the github API example, assuming the admin stats endpoint would always send back the ""collection of stats"" regardless of what you asked for, and if you only asked for say ""repos"" then the other items wouldnt be present (and thus would end up null in my c# object).But when doing the integration testing what i actually found was that only the ""All"" method returns back the outside collection (ie collection of stats entries), and all of the other ""specific"" requests only send back their specific json fragment and not the outer collection.  The API doc site only has the ""All"" example and not an example for say ""repo"" so this was a bit of an unexpected surprise :)Since I'd already coded it to have an Enum for the type of stats being requested, I took the ""easy"" way out and just populated the specific node in the AdminStats collection that is returned by the ALL stats call.  This meant there is 1 function, 1 return object (with field/s populated as appropriate), and an Enum to specify the type of stats you want.The alternative was to remove the enum and add specific functions for every type of request.  egand so on.As an end user I felt happy enough with the 1 function/1 return class/enum to specify what I want (most people would probably just request ALL stats anyway im assuming).  I felt like that was preferable to adding all the methods etc.  But a factor in that was the fact I'd already written most of the code that way...If you think it's more fitting with the rest of octokit.net, let me know and i can change it to the 11 specific functions for each request",,,,,,
50654246,1049,PullRequestReviewComment,"thanks for the extra context. I'm not feeling _strongly_ either way at this stage, I was just reflecting on how we don't really have a good example of another API that passes in an enum like this.For most of the existing API endpoints the parameters are bundled up into a single class - the `XYZRequest` overloads - but that's not really useful here. Whether you go with one method taking an enum of N values, or N methods each representing one endpoint, the only differences beyond the semantics are:- does one or the other make more sense to the consumer?- does one or the other make the implementation code easier or harder?For me, I think it's a little weird to always get an `AdminStats` response model back, even if I only asked for `users`. After the first time it failed, and I'd go ""ah, I want the `Users` property"" and update the code, but I'd love to :fire: the friction off completely.Do you think we'd get reuse from the existing response models you've created if we went down the ""one method per endpoint"" scenario? It's going to introduce more methods, but I think they'll be a lot more succinct (and simplify the tests a bit) if we can leverage the serialization cheats we've got to just get back the data we need.",,,,,,

As I think I said the main thing was that I'd already implemented it one way and then found out at integration testing that it behaves a bit differently when requesting specific stats vs all stats, and the api doc example only has one for the ""all"" case.  Writing individual methods is probably the way to go, it's just annoying that that means heaps more unit and integration tests, where the current tests can just `foreach` through the enum and cover all 11 request types in the one set of tests).

Provided as a property of GitHubClient which calls a property of Connection then a property of HttpClientAdapter.The most obvious use for it is to check the current rate limit without making a separate API call.Two concerns for me:- Can't put a test in for the HttpClientAdapter.  The underlying HttpClient is concrete and the send method is not virtual so can be substituted.  Could abstract the HttpClient (interface and wrapper) - this would help to put more testing into for the HttpClientAdapter (currently quite light).- Must be a better design than having to implement a property through every layerThanks,,,,,,

Created a separate ResourceRateLimit model rather than re-purpose the existing RateLimit.  I've chosen to keep them separate as they have such different source (API vs Header) and could be changed by GitHub independently.2. Created a structure made up of MiscRateLimt/ ResourcesRateLimits/ ResourcesRateLimit using the Poco Json deserialization - fitting the API structure.  Possibly better to perform custom deserialization (similar to ActivityPayload?) to return an array of a simple object (resource name, limit, remaining, reset).  Note entirely sure of the names either.3. I've included the depreciating ""Rate"" for completeness.  Given that it will depreciate, then maybe better to simply not get anyone into bad habits.  Would be removed anyway if I go for custom deserialization.4. To utilize Poco Json deserialization I've created a reset (long) and resetAsDateTimeOffset.  Better way to do?

If I run all the tests in Octokit I will be throttled by github.The second reason is that it helps encapsulate the creation and disposal logic, though it is a bit indirect and requires people to know them.I looked at the code and not having read it for 2-3 weeks, I have some suggestions which I would like to run by you guys.I define the name of the collection as a constant string in the collection class:Which I then use in the 'CollectionDefinition' attribute. On each test class instead of writing the string name of the collection, I use the constant string defined in the collection class:That should make it a bit less brittle than before.Furthermore the `RepositoriesHooksCollection` class is very small and very closely tied to the `RepositoriesHooksFixture` class. Would it be an idea to move the collection class into the same file as the fixture class. I am not normally a big fan of having two class inside the same file.",,,,,,

Just mentioning it incase you accidentally used it here.  This would be the first case of it's usage in test land so thought it worth pointing out.I guess I modelled it similarly to how `RequestsCorrectUrl` unit tests always hardcode the expected url rather than using the `ApiUrls` helper class like the implementation side does.

Thanks to the [pagination] APIs, this is rather easy to do. For my use case, that's been Good Enough. But I'm at the point where I'd like to do things like:- adjust the number of results per page- stop at a certain page number- skip certain pages- opt-in to preview API behaviour by overriding accepts headerSome endpoints support other sorts of filtering (for example, [issues search] has a `since` parameter. I'm not worrying about those here - this approach should work for all endpoints that return arrays of results.This isn't something I've focused on given I spent most of my days working with desktop apps, but I know other platforms would love having this level of control to conserve data.And we have #259 and #625 as open issues, so why not do try and resolve this?#### The ApproachYou can await any type in C# with the presence of `async`/`await` - and it's pretty easy once you know how to get started. For backwards-compatibility, I didn't want to force you to update your code - if you didn't opt-in to this behaviour, you should get the existing behaviour.So I started with this ideal API:Instead of returning `Task request)    {        Ensure.ArgumentNotNull(request, ""request"");        return request.ToTask();    }} csharpvar repositories = await github.Repository.GetAllForCurrent()    .WithOptions(new ApiOptions { PageSize = 10, PageCount = 1 });`#### Limitations~~I need to think about how to do this with the Observable-based APIs - currently we just cheat and transform the Task-based API, but because we surface an  `IObservable` we'd need to do something similar here. Plus there are extension methods like `Skip` and `Take` available that we should be respecting (and not fetching all the records in the first place). Perhaps this is when the two libraries diverge, implementation-wise :cry:~~ **EDIT:** we actually use a different implementation inside the `GetAll`s for the observable clients - `GetAndFlattenAllPages` - so I'm gonna put this question aside for another day.#### TODO- [x] unbreak all the tests- [x] resolve muted fx:cop: issues- [x] `ILazyRequest` -> `IDeferredRequest`- [ ] finish `RepositoriesClient` migration- [x] experiment with content responses in Issue Comments- ~~[ ] ponder on how to do this with `Octokit.Reactive`~~ :boot: punt to another time",,,,,,

And we have a separate `ApiResponse`. However that means that any implementations of `IHttpClient` would be responsible not only for creating a response, but deserializing it.

In the interest of keeping close to the API, there's only one method called `GetContents` that maps to the [""Get contents"" API]. I was able to accomplish this by changing the serializer a bit. When it's trying to deserialize a JSON object into an `IEnumerable` but the JSON text is clearly a `T` and not an array, I simply wrap the json text with square brackets turning it into an array of one item and then deserialize it.The other bit I had to do is when creating content, the text of the content needs to be base64 encoded. Also, when requesting content, the data is base64 encoded. So I changed the serializer to handle this transparently by simply applying the `SerializeAsBase64` attribute.

The Repository property for the Head and Base references was always returning null, instead of a valid Repository.The problem was that the JSON API uses ""repo"" as the field name, but the object model was expecting ""Repository"".The issue here seemed similar to what was fixed by  for #387, but instead of adding another special case to the name mapping, I updated the serialization logic to allow ""[Parameter]"" to control the JSON Field name.  It looks like this was the intention based on how the GitReference object was designed.The first three commits in the PR are small changes to SimpleJson itself.  I would be happy to try to get these changes pushed up stream if you feel this is the correct approach to the problem.  I did not do this proactively as I figured there was no reason to spend them time doing so if you'd rather I take a different approach.  The final commit are the changes to the Ocotokit codebase to start using [Parameter] as a way to control serialization.I did not add a specific test for deserializing a Pull Request object.  The root cause of the issue is due to an impedance mismatch between the JSON response and the object model we deserialize to, which is already covered by an existing test, for the ""_links"" behavior.

18742547,561,PullRequestReviewComment,"The PATCH verb is a tricky beast. Based on the nature of the PATCH  verb I believe it quite reasonable to have all fields nullable (unless the documentation states _required_) so that it may adhere to the PATCh standard : Used for updating resources with partial JSON data. For instance, an Issue resource has title and body attributes. A PATCH request may accept one or more of the attributes to update the resource.It's not necessarily that a value must be true or false because in a PATCH request a null (or absence of a value/field) is a reasonable request as well. For example: If this was still a non-nullable field it would mean that the serialize would serialize the value whether you set it or not. However, this is not desirable. I, as a user, don't want to be forced in sending data that I don't want to change. This means that if I wanted to update the title of the Release I must also know the previous state of the ""Draft"" field so that I may maintain it's value.",,,,,,
18742582,561,PullRequestReviewComment,"This follows the other comment I made about the importance that the PATCH model object be completely nullable with the exception of the _required_ fields. In this case, there is a drastic difference between the labels field being null and it being an empty list. For example: If I want to change the title of an issue and only the title when I instantiate this `IssueUpdate` model it automatically sets the `Labels` to an empty list. When I send the request, the serializer will serialize the request as:which GitHub will interpret as ""i want this issue to have no labels"". However, what really should have happened is that, because the ""Labels"" was null, the serialize did not serialize the field:and thus GitHub did not modify the Labels resource on the other side and only modified the title.",,,,,,

It makes it completely transparent to Octokit and it has the added benefit of supporting all of the other http headers that deal with caching (well, `If-Modified-Since` at least).Doing it in the layer below means no custom cache repositories, no sqlite, no custom file-level cache storage and/or in-memory storage (and the problems associated with that) and apps relying on it won't have to provide a place or provider to store/cache. WinInet will persist responses to disk without us ever having to worry about it and no consumer of this library will have to pick a location for storage or chose between in-memory vs disk vs sqlite.In order to utilize the WinInet cache **I needed to add a reference to** `System.Net.Http.WebRequest` which is a no-go on WinRT and mono.

Whenever the method was notasync and there was no reason to await to get to the exception.In the remaining cases they were simply awaited. I also took the liberty of making the lambdas not async whenever possible since awaiting the result returned by the method under test is already handled inside `AssertEx.Throw`.Other ones were validations on `Substitute` objects that were missing the `Receive()`. And some cases of missing receives that were trying to validate the wrong call.If we'd rather have the `Assert.Throw` calls changed into awaited `AssertEx.Throw` I should be able to do that fairly quickly.

Let me explain.When I send this:I get this (modified for succinctness):Switching it over to /issues/ is the fix:which gives me: Why am I raising this?

7739782,228,PullRequestReviewComment,There are three different type of comments to consider here:1. The issue comments2. The pull request comments3. The pull request review commentsWhat I was supposed to implement was the pull request review comments. On my pull request it didn't return any result because there was no review comment. Since you just added one now there is one result (and there will be two after I post this one :smile:) .I think this [page] of the API documentation needs to be updated as this is where you're supposed to fetch the comments associated with a pull request. We would then need to update this [issue] accordingly.Does that make sense (I might be completely mistaken as I'm brand new to the Github API)?,,,,,,

7708979,226,PullRequestReviewComment,how about something like this? Would this be a better fit for what you want?The way I see it is - if a user wants a specific operator i.e. `Size` you must instantiate the class. That way we can force certain operators to be applied to our `query` variable.If `Size != null` get the `tostring()` and add it onto the params...,,,,,,
7708981,226,PullRequestReviewComment,We can stick the operators in here and if possible - reuse through the other searches?,,,,,,

7745047,226,PullRequestReviewComment,Also - do you want me to hide the properties? Do users really need to know that much detail. If you want me to use ctor's to instantiate the search then we should only show users what the need to see right?so line 77 above - should not be possible?,,,,,,

I did that to get it off the ground, atm your suggestion would be better suited for those 3 classes (inherit from RequestParameters). Does that make sense?

Here's what's done:- List releases for a repository- Create a release- Upload a release assetThis leaves these things not done:- Get a single release- Edit a release- Delete a release- List assets for a release- Get a single release asset- Edit a release asset- Delete a release assetThe implementation is mostly not hacky, and it has tests. The hackiest bit is getting the 'Accept' header right. Also, I hung everything off of RepositoriesClient. I'm going to move it to a new ReleasesClient.Feel free to nitpick everything. This is the first serious .net code I've written in a while.",,,,,,
6732996,47,PullRequestReviewComment,"Is there a better way to do this? This works, but feels weird. I tried using `""application/vnd.github.v3+json;charset=utf-8, application/vnd.github.manifold-preview""` as the Accept header for all requests, but that didn't seem to work. I should look at how octokit.rb does it. Or , do you have a suggestion?",,,,,,
6741379,47,PullRequestReviewComment,"Hmm, that seems like specific info to have up in your pipeline. FWIW, Octokit.rb follows a [simple philosophy] of providing positional arguments for required information and an options hash for passing arbitrary info to the server:We even allow some headers to be passed as first class options (as `:accept` in this case instead of `:headers => {:accept => ''}`). This allows us to use the same method to get a pull request back as JSON, `.diff`, or `.patch` from a single method.I know this doesn't translate 1-to-1 in static languages, but as a consumer of APIs I appreciate it when my libraries remove the tedium of calling HTTP while exposing its raw power when I need it. Then I'm not left waiting on a library for every API update enhancement.Just my $.02.  may have more applicable feedback.",,,,,,
6743715,47,PullRequestReviewComment,"I'll look into this. This is the first time we've run into this situation so we just didn't create a way to easily override it just yet.For the most part, we don't want callers to have to think about what `accept` to pass so we want to bake in the right defaults.",,,,,,

6725970,46,PullRequestReviewComment,"I'm not sure about the different ways we use a 202 in the API off-hand, but generally speaking 202 (Accepted) isn't always appropriate for retry. It doesn't look like we're actually using this anywhere yet, so let's just make sure we're only throwing this in the context of a 202 that actually means retry, and change this code doc to better explain when it will be thrown (i.e., when a 202 means retry in the context of a given API end-point).",,,,,,
6727486,46,PullRequestReviewComment,"Should this be nullable for API exceptions, like timeout, that won't have a status code?",,,,,,
6727545,46,PullRequestReviewComment,"So we do this on every 202 in GHfW seen here:  any reason for that? Maybe in Octokit, we don't automatically retry and let the caller do it, but I'd like to get more background on this first.",,,,,,
6727688,46,PullRequestReviewComment,see  and  for all teh backgrounds.In the GitHub API 202 means that they've queued up a resque job and that the results will be available in a bit. It's also the reason I wrote [RetryWithBackoffStrategy ].,,,,,,
6727814,46,PullRequestReviewComment,: We use 202 in this way _always_ for the GitHub API? Is it safe to treat all 202s this way?,,,,,,
6727900,46,PullRequestReviewComment,"401 is an interesting thing for us. Because we're always going against a known set of end-points, we can probably handle 401 more appropriately ourselves than surfacing it to the client; a 401 means we don't know who you are (either because it's a first challenge, or the API couldn't establish identity after the challenge's response). Not saying we shouldn't have this exception and throw it when it applies, but we should think about maybe having something more specific when it makes sense (like, if you try to do something on /user/xxx, and you didn't supply a credential, maybe a `CredentialRequired` is the best exception, or if 2FA failed, maybe a `TwoFactorRequired` exception makes more sense; those are both 401 cases). I'm just thinking aloud here, so maybe just ignore me, but generally speaking, I wonder if we can handle most of the 401s more specifically than just throwing a 401 to the caller.",,,,,,
6728035,46,PullRequestReviewComment,"Should we just be throwing an API exception here generally for any `4xx` or `5xx` status code that we don't special-case? For instance, why handle `Forbidden` specifically, since we're just throwing `ApiException`; we could just have a block after the special cases that throws `ApiException` with the status code and description for any error code > 399.",,,,,,
6728226,46,PullRequestReviewComment,ping . ^^^ Any thoughts on the above question?,,,,,,
6728258,46,PullRequestReviewComment,Agreed. I was going to address that once I start re-implementing GHfW's handling of this using Octokit. But that's generally the approach I'm thinking. Perhaps those exceptions derive from this or we might simply add a property to this. I haven't really thought that through yet.,,,,,,
6728314,46,PullRequestReviewComment,"Good question! I was doing what we're doing in GHfW but after searching the code, it doesn't make sense. :) I thought we might be keying off the exception message but we're not.",,,,,,
6728398,46,PullRequestReviewComment,"For some reason, that rubs me the wrong way. If the server times out, we'll get a `HttpStatusCode.RequestTimeout`. If the task is cancelled, I think we probably shouldn't wrap that in an `ApiException` because it really wasn't an exception with the API. I think that implies the user cancelled the action (which we really don't allow just yet).Again, I was just mimicing the existing code but I think this is a case where that's a bad idea. I'll fix it.",,,,,,
6728497,46,PullRequestReviewComment,"I feel ya. There's also the third case of the client timing out, or will it also end up a task cancellation same as if a user cancelled the task explicitly? I wouldn't want to have to catch `TaskCanceledException` as a way to know if the client timed out waiting for the server. There also another exception that isn't going to have a status code: the server cannot be reach (bad URL, for example).",,,,,,
6728675,46,PullRequestReviewComment,"We use 202 in a number of contexts. In addition to the Stats API mentioned above, we also return a 202 when a repo is forked and you definitely don't want to auto-retry there. I think we'll also be using 202 to signal a Release Asset retry when we get a chance to implement it. See .",,,,,,

This [bug in GHfW] is an example of showing that we've had bugs with constructing URLs before.2. This is the approach the Mac Chaps use (according to ).3. I believe this is the approach recommended by  and others on the API team.I'm going to guess we'll eventually have scenarios that need us to try and construct a page URL.

Rename the library to Octopi per team consensus.2. Implement all the features we use in GHfW (and pretty much only those).3.
